The nationwide protests took place on the same day that President Aleksandar Vucic held a big afternoon rally with thousands of supporters in the central town of Jagodina, his coalition stronghold, to counter the persistent anti-government protests that have challenged his tight grip on power for nearly three months.

Vucic told his supporters that the country has been “attacked both from outside and inside” by the anti-government protests.

“It is not accidental that that they have attacked Serbia from abroad,” Vucic said, pointing out Serbia’s friendly relations with Russia and China, and a refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow because of the war in Ukraine.

“That is what they want to crush, but we must not allow it. That is our strength,” he told the cheering crowd.

Vucic also called for a dialogue with the striking students who have received widespread support from all walks of life in Serbia, at the same time weakening popular support for his party. The students have rejected negotiations on their demands with Vucic.

The protesters have blocked traffic daily in Serbia to protest the deaths of 15 people killed in the November collapse of a train station canopy that critics have blamed on government corruption.

Police in Belgrade said that they detained the 24-year-old driver who rammed into a crowd of protesters in a section of the city called New Belgrade. The injured victim, a 26-year-old woman was hospitalized; her condition was described as stable.

A similar incident took place during a blockade last week in Belgrade, when a car rammed into protesting students, seriously injuring a young woman.

Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption.

Weekslong protests demanding accountability over the crash have been the biggest since Vucic came to power more than a decade ago. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia.

It wasn’t immediately possible to determine how many people and companies joined the students’ call for a one-day general strike on Friday. They included restaurants, bars, theaters, bakeries, various shops and bookstores.

“Let’s take freedom in our hands,” students told the citizens in their strike call.

At his rally in Jagodina, Vucic announced the formation in March of a nationwide political movement in the style of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s United Russia movement to help ensure the dominance of his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party.

“You are all welcome to the movement of big change and future,” Vucic said. He said that the movement will include people who aren’t members of any political party.

“We need new energy,” Vucic said.

The president and the country’s mainstream media have accused the students of working under orders from foreign intelligence services to overthrow the authorities while pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked protesting citizens.

The 15-minute traffic blockades on Friday started at 11:52 a.m., the exact time of the canopy collapse in Novi Sad.

Serbian universities have been blockaded for two months, along with many schools. A lawyers’ association also has gone on strike, but it remained unclear how many people stayed away from work in the state-run institutions on Friday.

Protests marches were held Friday in Belgrade, Novi Sad, the southern city of Nis and other smaller cities — even in Jagodina before Vucic’s arrival.

“Things can’t stay the same anymore,” actor Goran Susljik told N1 regional television. “Students have offered us the possibility of change.”

Serbia’s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people for the canopy collapse, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister Goran Vesic has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation’s independence.

The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.

Analysis: Serbian PM Milos Vucevic's Resignation May Not Stop Protests - Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty,https://www.rferl.org/a/serbia-novisad-vucevic--vucic-protests/33291903.html,Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty,2025-01-28,"The resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic may not be enough to end student protests that have rocked the Balkan country since a disaster at a railway station killed 15 people in November.

This is despite the fact that Vucevic's resignation was among the protesters' initial demands. Their position has developed over months of protests that began when a concrete canopy collapsed at a station in the northern city of Novi Sad.

At first, the protesters called for both Vucevic and the mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Djuric, to go. Djuric also resigned from his position on January 28.

The resignations come following remarks by President Aleksandar Vucic on January 27, saying that all the students' demands will be met. Vucic appeared to be trying to defuse a situation where protests were growing nationwide.

Overnight, protesters were supported by farmers using tractors to mount a blockade of the main roads through the capital, Belgrade. Anger about the deaths has grown into wider grievances.

The protesters have said they're not interested in politics and do not see resignations as the core issue. Instead, they say they want Serbian institutions to work as they should.

""We would love to live in a country where every institution simply does its job independently, without corruption or external pressure,"" university student Jana Lomic told RFE/RL at one of the overnight blockades.

Many students camped out in tents.

They have the support of Serbia's opposition parties. It was announced this week that the government would submit to a confidence vote in parliament on January 29. The opposition said this was an old demand and that they supported the students' positions.

There are four major demands: The release of all documents covering the reconstruction of the station in Novi Sad amid concerns over corruption, dropping charges against students arrested during the initial protests, indictments against people who assaulted protesting students, and a 20 percent increase in government funding for state-run universities.

The government approved the 20 percent rise in its 2025 budget in December.

Vucic said all documents relating to the reconstruction of the railway station had been made public. But he has claimed this before and it is disputed by some protesters.

""We are always open to some form of negotiation and cooperation, but we don't want anyone to play games with us, and it is clear that this has been happening for two months,"" said Nikola Mutavdzic, a student at the Faculty of Law, who participated in the 24-hour traffic blockade in Belgrade on January 27.

Vucic also said charges against protesters would be dropped and that 37 individuals faced criminal proceedings for attacks on students. It's unclear whether all charges will be dropped, and if all alleged assaulters will be charged.

The student movement has no clear leaders. They take their decisions in votes.

It's also not clear what, if anything, will happen in parliament on January 29. A confidence vote when the prime minister has already resigned feels like an irrelevance that is also unlikely to calm public anger.

""With the resignation of the prime minister, the entire cabinet falls, so practically speaking, the entire government is resigning,"" Vucevic said on January 28.

The government is due to meet on the evening of January 28. Under the Serbian Constitution, it will remain in office for up to 30 days until a new government is approved by parliament.

If this does not happen, Vucic must call new parliamentary elections. Opposition parties have called for an interim government to be formed, something that is opposed by Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive Party."
"Analysis: Vučić is still protected by the EU and the US, but his government is wavering - Vijesti.me",https://en.vijesti.me/amp/743391/The-analyses-of-the-wolf-are-still-guarding-the-EU-now%2C-but-his-power-is-wavering.,Vijesti.me,2025-01-31,"Media and political analysts in the EU agree that Vučić's government has been shaken, and state that this is also demonstrated by the resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, who had to admit that the violence against students was carried out by ""thugs"" from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

The European Union and the United States are not yet challenging the shaky rule of Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, but the question is already being raised whether the end of his rule is in sight, according to analysts and media in the EU.

Media and political analysts in the EU agree that Vučić's government has been shaken, and state that this is also demonstrated by the resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, who had to admit that the violence against students was carried out by ""thugs"" from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

They also state that by forming a new government or calling elections, Vučić will ""only try to make changes so that everything remains the same because he holds all the strings of power.""

An analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, Enđelusa Morina, believes that demonstrations by students and broader sections of citizens in Serbia indicate that this could be the beginning of the end of Aleksandar Vučić's government, but adds that this process will take a long time.

Morina states that fundamental changes are necessary as there is great dissatisfaction among citizens due to violations of the law, suppression of government institutions and media freedom, as well as general corruption in government circles.

She points out that Vučić's government has been shaken ""because his moves show that he does not know how to address people in a way that makes proposals, but rather constantly sends messages to his supporters from the SNS, and not to broad sections of citizens dissatisfied with the suppression of laws and general corruption in government.""

The German Zidow Zeitung writes in a commentary that Vučić is not yet on the verge of collapse because he has a party apparatus that manages all companies and institutions, ""where jobs are distributed for votes for Vučić's camp.""

""Vučić is not under the protection of Brussels and Berlin only because of the lithium mining project, but also because he enables the Serbian military industry to produce weapons for Ukraine,"" the Süddeutsche Zeitung points out.

The newspaper also states that ""the apparatus of numerous regime television stations and tabloids is largely preventing the emergence of political alternatives.""

The German public service MDR points out that the student protest in Serbia originated exclusively on domestic soil, without logistical or financial assistance from the West, which supported democratic movements against dictatorship in the so-called ""color revolutions"" in other former communist countries.

""Moreover, the protest took place despite the position of the European Union and the USA, and even Germany, which have de facto supported the Serbian autocrat Vučić and his system of government for a decade, thereby contributing to the suppression of Serbian democracy,"" MDR states.

The French newspaper Lezeko writes that the Serbian government has been ""shaken by weeks of protests over incompetence and corruption in the country"" and adds that Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, ""a key ally of President Aleksandar Vučić, who has held Serbia with an iron fist for 11 years,"" had to resign.

The German Friedrich Naumann Foundation points out that the European Union has so far ""tolerated Aleksandar Vučić because he promised it stability and raw materials such as lithium"" and adds that people in Serbia are ""fully aware of this.""

""Towards candidates for membership, and Serbia still is, the EU could deal with violations of the rule of law in the same way it deals with violations within the Union, including financial sanctions. The absence of any criticism (from the EU), even during massive electoral fraud, has repeatedly left Serbian civil society in the lurch,"" the Friedrich Naumann Foundation states.

Vucevic on Tuesday became the highest-ranking official to step down in the aftermath of a roof collapse at a railway station in the city of Novi Sad in November that killed 15 people and triggered months of demonstrations over alleged poor government oversight.

President Vucic has 30 days to propose a new prime minister designate, or an election will be triggered. On Tuesday he said he would make a decision in around 10 days.

The protests have shaken Vucic, a populist, who held a grip on power since he became prime minister in 2014 and president in 2017.

But the Novi Sad incident has reignited claims that Vucic and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) are corrupt, bribe voters, stifle media freedom and maintain ties with organised crime - all charges he and the SNS deny.

It is not clear how he will fare if a snap election is called. In December, the IPSOS Strategic Marketing pollster said the SNS enjoyed the support of 48.3% of the electorate, although popular sentiment against the government has surged since then.

A decision by SNS to appoint an expert government would be its ""best hope of de-escalating the crisis"", said Andrius Tursa, the Central and Eastern Europe Advisor for the Teneo consultancy, in a report on Tuesday.

""For now, the president appears reluctant to go down this path, which would amount to a major political loss and reduce his leverage over the government.""

Opposition parties dismissed the possibility of an early vote and said that an interim government without the SNS would be the best solution.

The protests that triggered the political crisis began in Novi Sad in November but have grown and spread to most of Serbia and the capital Belgrade, where students who are leading the demonstrations blockaded a major intersection this week.

The streets of Belgrade were calm on Wednesday. But the students say they will continue to rally until their demands - which include all those they blame for the station disaster being held criminally responsible and an end to prosecutions of students arrested during the protests - are met.

They say Vucevic's decision can be seen as a proof of popular pressure.

""This only demonstrates social influence that ... protests and blockades could have,"" said Tijana Knezevic, a student activist."

Protestors block the road to pay respects to victims of fatal roof collapse in November 2024 at Novi Sad's railway station, in Belgrade

By Aleksandar Vasovic

BELGRADE (Reuters) -Serbia's ruling coalition began talks to form a new government on Wednesday, after Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned amid protests and President Aleksandar Vucic floated the possibility of a snap election in April.

Vucevic on Tuesday became the highest-ranking official to step down in the aftermath of a roof collapse at a railway station in the city of Novi Sad in November that killed 15 people and triggered months of demonstrations over alleged poor government oversight.

President Vucic has 30 days to propose a new prime minister designate, or an election will be triggered. On Tuesday he said he would make a decision in around 10 days.

The protests have shaken Vucic, a populist, who has held a grip on power since he became prime minister in 2014 and president in 2017.

But the Novi Sad incident has reignited claims that Vucic and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) are corrupt, bribe voters, stifle media freedom and maintain ties with organised crime - all charges he and the SNS deny.

The protests began in Novi Sad in November but have spread to rest of Serbia and the capital Belgrade, where students who are leading the demonstrations blockaded a major intersection this week.

HUNDREDS PROTEST

Hundreds took to the streets again on Wednesday, carrying banners that read ""Dare and Rise"" and ""Support to Students"".

They vowed to continue protesting until their demands - which include all those they blame for the station disaster being held criminally responsible and an end to prosecutions of students arrested during the protests - were met.

Later on Wednesday, Vucic's office said he has pardoned six students, a faculty dean, a university lecturer, headteachers of six schools and a janitor. All were prosecuted for their role in the protests.

""We are very satisfied with the successes we have achieved... but we are not asking for the resignations of officials, but rather for the fulfilment of the demands - that this state truly becomes a state of law instead of being a police state,"" said law student protester Igor Protic.

It is unclear how Vucic would fare if a snap election were called. In December, the IPSOS Strategic Marketing pollster said the SNS enjoyed the support of 48.3% of the electorate, although popular sentiment against the government has surged since then.

A decision by SNS to appoint an expert government would be its ""best hope of de-escalating the crisis"", said Andrius Tursa, the Central and Eastern Europe Advisor for the Teneo consultancy, in a report on Tuesday.

Encrypted Chats Expose Rival Factions Around Serbia’s Ruling Party - OCCRP,https://www.occrp.org/en/news/encrypted-chats-expose-rival-factions-around-serbias-ruling-party,OCCRP,2025-01-31,"A member of a Serbian organized crime group was striking deals with a businessman close to the country’s ruling party even as he allegedly coordinated international cocaine shipments, according to an investigation by KRIK.

Information about convicted drug trafficker Miloš Pandrc, and his connections to Serbia’s economic and political elite, is included in a police report from an investigation into Balkan organized crime that was obtained by journalists.

KRIK, which is an OCCRP member center in Serbia, also obtained text messages between Pandrc and his contacts. The communications were sent over Sky ECC, an encrypted messaging app sold to criminals around the world.

The police report and encrypted messages expose rifts between rival groups of businessmen and criminals in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second largest city. The factions appear to have been competing for the largesse of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

The messages include conversations in 2020 between Pandrc and Dragoljub Zbiljić, a businessman close to the SNS. In their exchanges, Zbiljić shared screenshots of text messages between himself and Miloš Vučević, who was then mayor of Novi Sad.

Vučević became Serbia’s prime minister in 2024. He resigned on Tuesday following months of anti-government protests sparked by the deadly collapse of a section of the Novi Sad railway station.

Back in 2020, Vučević was regularly sharing updates with Zbiljić about internal SNS developments. Zbiljić forwarded some of these messages to Pandrc.

The police report and encrypted messages reveal details of Zbiljić’s acquisition of Elektromontaža, a company that handles lucrative state energy projects. Pandrc allegedly benefitted from the deal too.

“Pandrc says he arranged an €800,000 ($946,000) deal with Elektromontaža,” the police report states, adding that “he plans to increase it to €100 million ($118 million) annually starting next year.”

Journalists were unable to confirm whether Pandrc did indeed receive any of those funds. Pandrc did not answer his phone, and attempts to reach him via calls to his family and his company were unsuccessful.

Neither Vučević nor the Serbian government responded to requests for comment.

Zbiljić declined to answer questions, but suggested in an email that KRIK journalists “consult a serious psychiatrist.”

While Pandrc was chatting with Zbiljić and others in 2020, he was also messaging cocaine traffickers over the encrypted Sky ECC app.

""It is evident that Pandrc Miloš has an interest in the international trade of narcotics,” police alleged in their report, which cites his communications to several other Sky ECC users.

Pandrc was communicating with them “in order to facilitate an agreement related to the transportation of a large quantity of the narcotic drug cocaine from Brazil to Germany,"" police alleged."
EU criticized for staying silent on momentous protests in Serbia - European Western Balkans,https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2025/01/29/eu-criticized-for-staying-silent-on-momentous-protests-in-serbia/,European Western Balkans,2025-01-29,"Since the protests in Serbia began following the tragic collapse of the Novi Sad railway station in November, very few reactions have been heard from the EU. The protests, meanwhile, have evolved into a large student-led movement which ultimately caused the fall of the government, following yesterday’s resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević.

Protesters demand the release of full documentation on the reconstruction of the railway station, whose collapse killed 15 people. Numerous shortcomings in the work of the institutions have already come to light regarding the project, and suspicions of potential corruption persist in the public. Another demand is the prosecution of persons who physically assaulted the students during the protests, some of whom were identified as members of the ruling party.

For weeks, tens of thousands of citizens have been protesting across the country in support of the students. The protests further escalated in the second half of January after several incidents in which protesting students were injured. Commentators are describing the protests as a decisive moment for the future of the rule of law and democracy in Serbia.

So far, however, there have been very few reactions from the EU institutions or member governments. They mostly came from several groups in the European Parliament – Socialists and Democrats, Greens and “Renew Europe”, which supported the students. European Commission Spokesman for Enlargement has also criticized the attacks on the students.

No reactions came from the higher levels of the Commission or the Council of the European Union. In his last week’s visit to Serbia, Gert Jan Koopman, head of the Directorate-General for Neighourhood and Enlargement in the European Commission, made no public reference to the protests.

Pro-government daily Politika subsequently published what it reported to be a leaked message of Koopman from the meeting with opposition and civil society, in which he allegedly said that the EU “will not accept or support a violent change of power in Serbia.” Upon subsequent request, the EU institutions did not provide a detailed clarification of the statement for our portal.

Meanwhile, officials of the United States, Russia and China have recently made statements critical of the protests and supportive of the government. Richard Grenell, well-known in the Balkans from his previous stint in the Trump administration, criticized the supposed violence of the protests during the weekend, even though the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful.

Calls for the EU to get more involved

On 28 January, a group of Serbian public figures, including writers, actors and activists, sent a letter to the EU officials, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos, urging them to take a more active role in support of the “free, democratic and European Serbia”.

“The rule of this regime all these years would not have been possible without, unfortunately, a very ambivalent and inconsistent policy of the European Union towards Serbia, which in recent years often reduced to the open support of the government of Aleksandar Vučić”, the letter states.

In a text published last week on the BiEPAG blog, titled “Student protests in Serbia: The eleventh hour for EU fundamentals”, author Marko Kmezić wrote that the EU continues to fail “to recognize the country’s regime for what it actually is – an autocratic and corrupt political system unfit to meet EU conditions with regard to respect and promotion of democracy, rule of law and human rights”.

“It is the eleventh hour for the EU to step up and fulfil its self-proclaimed task of democracy and rule of law promoter. It must clearly and univocally support the student protests in Serbia and stop having stabilitocratic consideration for the country’s authoritarian regime”, Kmezić, s a Lecturer and Senior Researcher at the Centre for Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, wrote.

Issues with Novi Sad railway reconstruction recognized in the EU’s own reports

Novi Sad tragedy has renewed interest in the longstanding issues with construction projects in the country. In its annual Report on Serbia, published on 30 October 2024, just two days before the collapse of the station, the European Commission stated that the country “has a tendency to circumvent its legislation” in the area of public procurement “through intergovernmental agreements and special laws”.

This was exactly how the Novi Sad railway station was reconstructed. There was no open competition – the project was awarded to a consortium of Chinese companies, which hired local subcontractors, based on the Serbia-China international agreement. The price of the reconstruction of the station has been described as potentially inflated by several experts.

The protesters have been demanding the release of all documentation related to the Novi Sad railway reconstruction so that all technical shortcomi"
Government Crisis in Serbia: Vucic to Decide on Elections Within Days - Novinite.com,https://www.novinite.com/articles/230566/Government+Crisis+in+Serbia%3A+Vucic+to+Decide+on+Elections+Within+Days,Novinite.com,2025-01-29,"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced that consultations are beginning to determine whether a new government will be formed or if early elections will be necessary. He stated that within 10 days, it will be clear whether Serbia will head to the polls or if a governing coalition can be established following the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic. If the talks among parliamentary parties do not yield a positive outcome, elections could take place as early as April.

Amid growing political tensions, Vucic rejected opposition demands for a transitional government to oversee fair and democratic elections. He also announced his decision to pardon 13 individuals who participated in anti-government protests.

Meanwhile, demonstrations continued in Belgrade, Novi Sad, and other cities, fueled by public outrage over the beating of a student involved in the protests. Police have detained four suspects in connection with the attack. In response, Prime Minister Vucevic and Novi Sad Mayor Milan Duric took political responsibility and resigned.

In Novi Sad, large crowds gathered outside the ruling Serbian Progressive Party's office, chanting slogans such as ""Get out"" and ""First resign, then go to jail."" The protests, which have been ongoing for three months, were initially triggered by the collapse of the newly renovated train station canopy, an incident that claimed 15 lives.

Following the peace accord that ended the Kosovo conflict in 1999, Kosovo came under UN administration, and UN peacekeeping forces were deployed there. Tension between Albanians and Serbs continued, and Kosovo declared independence in 2008.

The Kosovo conflict occurred in 1998–99 when ethnic Albanians fought ethnic Serbs and the government of Yugoslavia in Kosovo . The conflict gained widespread international attention and was resolved with the intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Kosovo conflict, (1998–99) conflict in which ethnic Albanians opposed ethnic Serbs and the government of Yugoslavia (the rump of the former federal state, comprising the republics of Serbia and Montenegro) in Kosovo. The conflict gained widespread international attention and was resolved with the intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

In 1989 Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo, initiated a policy of nonviolent protest against the abrogation of the province’s constitutional autonomy by Slobodan Milošević, then president of the Serbian republic. Milošević and members of the Serbian minority of Kosovo had long objected to the fact that Muslim Albanians were in demographic control of an area held sacred to the Serbs. (Kosovo was the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church as well as the site of the Turkish defeat of the Serbs in 1389 and the Serbian victory over the Turks in 1912.) Tensions increased between the two ethnic groups, and the international community’s refusal to address the issue lent support to Rugova’s more radical opponents, who argued that their demands could not be secured through peaceful means. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) emerged in 1996, and its sporadic attacks on Serbian police and politicians steadily escalated over the next two years.

By 1998 the KLA’s actions could be qualified as a substantial armed uprising. Serbian special police and, eventually, Yugoslav armed forces attempted to reassert control over the region. Atrocities committed by the police, paramilitary groups, and the army caused a wave of refugees to flee the area, and the situation became well publicized through the international media. The Contact Group—an informal coalition of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia—demanded a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serbian forces from Kosovo, the return of refugees, and unlimited access for international monitors. Milošević, who had become president of Yugoslavia in 1997, agreed to meet most of the demands but failed to implement them. The KLA regrouped and rearmed during the cease-fire and renewed its attacks. The Yugoslav and Serbian forces responded with a ruthless counteroffensive and engaged in a program of ethnic cleansing. The United Nations (UN) Security Council condemned this excessive use of force and imposed an arms embargo, but the violence continued.

Diplomatic negotiations began in Rambouillet, France, in February 1999 but broke down the following month. On March 24 NATO began air strikes against Serbian military targets. In response, Yugoslav and Serbian forces drove out all of Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians, displacing hundreds of thousands of people into Albania, Macedonia (now North Macedonia), and Montenegro. The NATO bombing campaign lasted 11 weeks and eventually expanded to Belgrade, where significant damage to the Serbian infrastructure occurred. In June NATO and Yugoslavia signed a peace accord outlining troop withdrawal and the return of nearly one million ethnic Albanians as well as another 500,000 displaced within the province. Most Serbs left the region, and there were occasional reprisals against those who remained. UN peacekeeping forces were deployed in Kosovo, which came under UN administration.

Tensions between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo continued into the 21st century. Sporadic violence occurred, as when anti-Serb riots broke out in March 2004 in numerous cities and towns in the Kosovo region. The riots claimed some 30 lives and resulted in the displacement of more than 4,000 Serbs and other minorities. In February 2008 Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia (Yugoslavia had ceased to exist in 2003, giving way to the federation of Serbia and Montenegro, which itself dissolved in 2006). Although the United States and several influential members of the European Union chose to recognize Kosovo’s independence, Serbia did not."

They provided full support, as they said, ""to liberate the information program of the public service from the illegal and pernicious influence of the current government on freedom of expression.""

The Serbian Progressive Party called yesterday's reporting by RTS scandalous and accused ""those who are supposed to represent the public service of the citizens of Serbia"" that ""by taking the side of politicians who would destroy the constitutional order of Serbia, they grossly violated all the codes of journalism and grossly abused the journalistic profession"".

Today, the NUNS state that the ruling party is ""dissatisfied"" because the newsroom of RTS, after almost three months since the beginning of the student protests, began to report more objectively and impartially.

""We remind you that the editorial staff of RTS initially ignored the student protests, did not view them as events of exceptional public importance, and at the same time conveyed false accusations against students as facts, such as the untrue claim of the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, ""that young people are arguing heatedly, and even and they physically calculate due to the distribution of the money they receive from the country and abroad for the organization of the protest"".

According to this association, the SNS liked to ""ignore and falsely report on civil protests"".

""It was expected that they had no objections to yesterday's news broadcasts by four televisions with national coverage - Pink, Prva, Happy and B92, which continued to abuse the national frequency with lies, manipulations and hate speech and unscrupulously violate the Law on Public Information and Media, the Law on electronic media, as well as the Serbian Code of Journalists"".

On the other hand, they say that yesterday for the first time RTS reported on the events in Serbia ""on time, professionally and in accordance with the ethical code of the profession and legal obligations"".

They believe, they say further, that they will continue reporting - ""regardless of pressure and blackmail.""

""That's why we call on the provincial public service - RTV, to follow the example of RTS and stop being a mere propaganda tool of the ruling party."""
Protesters block bridges in Serbia's Novi Sad over November train disaster - News.Az,https://news.az/news/protesters-block-bridges-in-serbia-s-novi-sad-over-november-train-disaster,News.Az,2025-02-01,"Tens of thousands of people blockaded three bridges on the Danube River in Serbia's second city of Novi Sad on Saturday in the latest anti-government protest over a railway station disaster that killed 15 people in November, News.az reports citing Reuters.

Protests over the deaths caused by a roof collapsing at a station in Novi Sad quickly ballooned and spread across the Balkan country, triggering a political crisis.

Prosecutors have so far charged 13 people over the disaster, but protesters, opposition parties and many Serbians blame the tragedy on corruption within President Aleksandar Vucic's government and mismanagement.

Students from Belgrade - some of whom had covered the 80 km distance on foot - merged on Saturday with residents and university students of Novi Sad, the capital of the Vojvodina province in Serbia's north.

After rallying for a few hours on two of the bridges, they planned to remain until Sunday on Freedom Bridge, the largest of the three.

Some of the protesters held banners reading ""Your hands are bloodied!” and ""Corruption kills!""

Milos Vucevic resigned as prime minister this week, the highest-ranking official to step down over the disaster. Before him, two other ministers had stepped down.

Vucevic's resignation has rocked the government and Vucic, a centre-right populist and former Serb nationalist firebrand who has held a grip on power since he became prime minister in 2014 and president in 2017.

Although his role is meant to be largely ceremonial, he is viewed as wielding huge influence over the ruling Serbian Progressive Party and the government.

Critics have accused Vucic and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) of bribing voters, violence against opponents, stifling media freedoms and ties with organised crime - charges he and the SNS deny.

""Our goal is to have all our demands fulfilled so that we can finally start to live in a state of law,"" said protester Ana Hasinbegovic.

Vucic, who said he would decide next week whether to nominate a new prime minister or trigger snap elections in April, said on Saturday that he will not step down because of popular discontent.

The end of the Union marked the closing chapter in the separation of the six republics of the old Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, which was proclaimed in 1945 and comprised Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.

Yugoslavia's communist leader, Josip Broz Tito, kept the lid on ethnic tensions. The federation lasted for over 10 years after his death in 1980, but under Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic it fell apart through the 1990s.

The secession of Slovenia and Macedonia came relatively peacefully, but there were devastating wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia and Montenegro together formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2003 before forming a looser union.

Students have taken the lead with the protests, halting traffic daily and blockading universities for months.

Last Friday, many Serbians stayed off work in response to a call for a general strike, while in December an estimated 100,000 people attended a demonstration in Belgrade. Many smaller protests have been held in towns and cities across the country.

Tensions rose on Monday when, during a 24-hour blockade of the busiest road junction in the capital, Belgrade, supporters of the governing Progressive Party attacked and injured a female student in Serbia's second city, Novi Sad.

Serbia PM Miloš Vučević Resigns Amid Canopy Collapse Protests - Lawyer Monthly Magazine,https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/01/serbia-pm-milos-vucevic-resigns-amid-canopy-collapse-protests/,Lawyer Monthly Magazine,2025-01-28,"Serbia PM Miloš Vučević Resigns Amid Canopy Collapse Protests.

Serbia’s Prime Minister Miloš Vučević announced his resignation on January 23, 2025, after weeks of massive protests across the country in response to the tragic collapse of a concrete canopy in November 2024, which resulted in multiple deaths. The protestors, demanding justice for the victims, have accused the government of widespread corruption and negligence in safety oversight, which they believe contributed to the deadly incident.

In his resignation speech, Vučević called for calm and dialogue, stating: “It is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue.” Alongside his own resignation, Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also stepped down. Vučević’s departure is expected to trigger early parliamentary elections, as his resignation must be confirmed by Serbia’s parliament within 30 days, which could lead to the formation of a new government or a snap election.

The protests, which had been intensifying for weeks, saw a significant show of support on Monday, when tens of thousands of demonstrators, including striking university students, blocked a major traffic intersection in Belgrade. The students, who have led the charge against government corruption, have been demanding accountability for the canopy collapse, which critics say was enabled by widespread corruption at various levels of government.

In a bid to ease the mounting tensions, Vučević, alongside President Aleksandar Vučić and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabić, called for a return to dialogue with the students. The student protests have resonated across various sectors of Serbian society, with many supporting their call for justice and reforms.

While Serbia’s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 individuals, including a government minister and several state officials, public skepticism remains. The release of former Construction Minister Goran Vesic from detention, in particular, has raised doubts about the independence of the investigation into the canopy collapse. This has further fueled concerns that the investigation might be compromised.

Meanwhile, incidents during the street demonstrations have raised alarm. In Novi Sad, two separate attacks on protesters by drivers in vehicles resulted in injuries to two women. On Tuesday, students reported that one of their peers was severely injured in an assault by individuals armed with baseball bats. The students condemned the violence, with one group stating in an Instagram post: “We are horrified over the state of our society where such a situation is possible. We have had enough of blood.” They called for a rally later that day to continue their demand for justice.

To honour the victims of the November tragedy, students and activists have been holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades across Serbia at 11:52 a.m., marking the exact time the canopy collapsed and killed 15 people, including two children.

As the political and social unrest continues, the resignation of Vučević and Djuric may mark the beginning of significant political changes in Serbia, with the protests demanding not only accountability for the tragic incident but also broader reforms in government and infrastructure oversight."
Serbia protests: What's next after prime minister resigns? - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/serbia-protests-whats-next-after-prime-minister-resigns/a-71438997,DW (English),2025-01-28,"The resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic is unlikely to quell the massive protests of recent weeks, putting the country's all-powerful president, Aleksandar Vucic, under unprecedented pressure.

Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned on Tuesday, as months of student and civic protests began to take their political toll.

Vucevic is a member of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and a close political ally of President Aleksandar Vucic.

The mayor of Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, and fellow SNS party member Milan Djuric also resigned.

""This shows that we who were elected to assume responsibility are assuming responsibility so that the situation does not spill over onto the streets and lead to disputes between citizens and divisions in society,"" Vucevic said at a press conference in Belgrade.

Shock at developments in Novi Sad

The resignations came the day after news reports from Novi Sad shocked the nation. On Monday evening, students were posting stickers calling for new protests outside the office of the ruling SNS when they were attacked with clubs by assailants who emerged from the building.

According to media reports, the students were brutally beaten, and one young woman was taken to hospital with a fractured jaw.

The attack occurred just a few hours after both the president and prime minister had called for dialogue and claimed to have met all the students' demands.

Almost three months of protests

The protests began in November 2024 after a canopy at Novi Sad railway station collapsed, killing 15 people. Since then, a growing number of citizens have been blaming the tragedy and shoddy construction work on widespread corruption in Serbia.

The students are calling for the publication of all documents relating to the renovation of the railway station, which was completed shortly before the canopy collapse, and the arrest of those responsible.

But the protests are also taking aim at President Vucic himself, who is seen as the head of the patronage system that prevails in Serbia.

Initial responses to Tuesday morning's announcement indicate that Vucevic's resignation will unlikely stop the protests.

""These resignations come at least three months too late,"" said Pavle Grbovic, president of the opposition Movement of Free Citizens (PSG) party. ""The tension and the violence could have been less if these people had acted in a moral and timely manner. Now it just looks like they want to limit the obvious damage to the SNS's standing in the opinion polls,"" he told DW.

It is unclear whether the government will try to call early elections in the current heated atmosphere or whether, more likely, a new prime minister will be appointed. The opposition would probably boycott the vote if the government opts for a snap election.

President under pressure

The recent protests have been backed by entire universities, schools, lawyers' practices and cultural institutions, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets to demonstrate.

A 24-hour blockade of the Autokomanda, a major traffic intersection in Belgrade, that caused major traffic disruptions ended on Tuesday.

""We are here to show solidarity and nobleness,"" student Lazar Ristanovic told DW on Monday as tents were being put up behind him.

Some students spent the night on the intersection. ""There are more and more of us every day. They can't stop this many people, and we won't stop until our demands are met,"" Ristanovic said.

Vucic has ruled Serbia with an iron hand for over a decade. Until now, protests never posed a threat to him, but things seem to be different this time.

Vucic is well versed in the strategy of power and has strong links both in the West and in Russia and China. Until now, he has responded to the protesters' demands with daily, frequently heated appearances on pro-government television channels.

However, in an address to the nation on Monday evening, he appeared unusually calm and indicated a willingness to negotiate. He said all of the students' demands were being met, explaining that the government was releasing the remaining documents — tens of thousands of pages — relating to the renovation of Novi Sad station.

""The current situation threatens our economic growth,"" said Vucic. ""We must go back to work. The country must function.""

Attacks on protesters

During his resignation speech on Tuesday, Vucevic repeated President Vucic's claim that the protests are being orchestrated from ""abroad"" and seek to destroy Serbian unity.

“I joined the demonstration because I support the students’ demands. I stand with them because I still believe in justice,” says R., from Novi Sad. 

The northern Serbian city was flooded with students and citizens who occupied the three urban bridges crossing the Danube from 3 PM to 6 PM on February 1. The largest, Liberty Bridge, remained blocked until February 2 at 2 PM. “Three months – Three bridges” is the slogan that highlights the reason for their gathering: the demand for justice for the 15 people who died when the station roof collapsed on November 1. Many blame the incident on a system of corruption and poor oversight of infrastructure projects by the right-wing populist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) government.

Protests were organized by university students’ unions, providing real-time updates via social media. Tractors moved through the streets, with farmers leading three distinct groups of students marching toward the bridges, while thousands of locals lined the route, cheering them on. They stationed themselves at both ends of Novi Sad bridges, making noise with drums and chants. Many gathered in the park next to Liberty Bridge, playing basketball or dancing. Volunteers and citizens set up stands offering free food and drinks. Many in the crowd waved Serbian flags or held banners proclaiming, “We are defending freedom.”

“The energy was so good. So many people came from other cities too. It’s a historic moment, and it’s amazing to witness it. These young generations are bringing back hope to us. The power of youth and education is transformative in a way. People were crying, crying with joy. There were so many emotions,” tells F., another Novi Sad native.

Context of the protest
The February 1 protest continued the march of students who arrived in Novi Sad on January 31, after a two-day walk from the capital, Belgrade. Fireworks and applause marked their entry into the town of Inđija, halfway through their journey. During the night, most camped outdoors, as the municipality did not let them inside of the sports stadium. A small red carpet was laid out on the bridge they crossed to enter Novi Sad. Smiles, shouts, trumpet sounds, and bells accompanied their arrival.

“I saw many young people and students being welcomed by the citizens. Beyond that, I saw love, pride, and hope on people’s faces. It is an image I will never forget,” says R. The procession then moved toward the station to honor the victims of November 1 by laying wreaths bearing their names.


Students arriving in Novi Sad on January 31
This marks the peak of the uprisings that have shaken Serbia since the station incident. “That day, I felt angry, scared, and disappointed. I think we have all felt that way, every day, for the past three months,” recalls R. 

Some students have been arrested or attacked during protests, while others have been run over while marching peacefully. Despite this, demonstrations have continued—including a general strike and a 24-hour occupation of a major highway intersection in Belgrade. Universities have been shut down for two months by student movements, followed by school closures.

Future perspectives
The growing tension led to the resignations of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević and the Mayor of Novi Sad on January 28. On January 31, President Aleksandar Vučić stated that “it is clear that the country is under attack both from outside and within,” adding, “We will know how to fight back; we will be flexible, we will seek dialogue and confrontation (with the protesters), but we will know how to save the country.”

Students insist they will not stop until their demands are fulfilled: prosecution of those responsible for attacks on demonstrators, the release of activists and students arrested for protesting, full transparency and publication of documents identifying those responsible for the Novi Sad tragedy, a 20% increase in state funding for public universities.

Vučić claims these requests have been met, but students dispute his words, arguing that those responsible for the station collapse have yet to be identified and held accountable."

Protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic's government have been taking place almost daily since the Novi Sad train station collapse last November, which killed 15 people. Vucevic is a close ally of the president.

What did Vucevic say?

Addressing a press conference in Belgrade, the prime minister described the resignation as an ""irrevocable decision.""

""I had a long meeting with the president of Serbia this morning. We talked about this. We talked about everything, and he accepted my arguments,"" he added. ""So in order to avoid further complicating things, so we do not further raise tensions in society, I made this decision.""

He said that he and government ministers would remain in office in working capacity until a new cabinet is formed.

In his address, Vucevic pointed to an attack on student protesters in Novi Sad that occurred the previous day, adding that one student was injured by the attackers.

He also accused critics of the government of taking advantage of the train station canopy collapse for ""political"" purposes.

Vucevic said that Novi Sad's mayor, Milan Duric, had also presented his resignation.

Vucevic has been in office for less than a year. He had earlier served as Novi Sad mayor from 2012 to 2022. His term coincided with the time renovations in the city's now collapsed train station began.

Demonstrators blame the incident on widespread corruption, nepotism and poor construction work and have called for swifter judicial action against those found responsible.

Former Transport Minister Goran Vesic resigned days after the collapse. He and several others have been charged in connection with the incident.

Vucevic's decision came just one day after President Aleksandar Vucic announced plans to initiate a major government overhaul in response to mounting demands from striking university students.

The protests, which have intensified over the past few weeks, culminated in a 24-hour blockade of a major intersection in Belgrade on Monday. This action, joined by Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens, was a direct response to the collapse in Novi Sad, the northern city and regional capital. Critics argue that the accident was a result of widespread government corruption, and the ongoing demonstrations have been seen as the largest challenge to Vucic's populist administration in recent years.

In an attempt to ease tensions, Vucic, alongside Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, called for dialogue with the protesting students, emphasizing the need for communication to lower the growing unrest. At the press conference, Vucic warned that such a crisis could severely harm Serbia's economy, adding that the ongoing social turmoil was detrimental to all involved.

In the wake of the resignation, Novi Sad's mayor Milan Duric, a key figure in the government, also announced he would step down. Vucevic, who previously served as Novi Sad's mayor from 2012 to 2022, has faced increasing pressure to take responsibility for the collapse.

With Vucevic’s resignation, Serbia is likely headed toward an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be formally confirmed by the country’s parliament, which now has 30 days to appoint a new government or call for snap elections.

Serbia’s Mass Protests Against a Crony-Capitalist Government - Jacobin magazine,https://jacobin.com/2025/02/serbia-protests-novi-sad-railway,Jacobin magazine,2025-02-01,"Soon after the roof canopy of Novi Sad’s central train station collapsed last November 1, killing fifteen people, a TV reporter asked local journalist Igor Mihaljević to respond to the event. With devastating and incisive judgement, he offered the context missing in Western media coverage of the incident and the protests of the last few months. For one, Mihaljević noted, this was the latest incident in the often tragic history of Serbia’s second-largest city. In its past, Novi Sad suffered the genocidal Hungarian army campaign that massacred Jews, Serbs, and Romani across the region. That was in the same era as the devastating military occupation of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany and its client states. More recently, there was the seventy-eight-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999, which killed 527 Yugoslavs and hobbling major cities like Novi Sad by taking out key infrastructure. But this time, Mihaljević argued, was different — for now it was the Serbian state itself killing its people. The train station collapse has left both the city and the nation in shock, triggering primal fears of the sky falling overhead. Many Serbs, especially in Novi Sad, now regard overhead structures with suspicion, with some even avoiding the newly constructed, Chinese-funded high-speed railway. However, the aftermath has also sparked a powerful wave of protests, so intense that they threaten to topple President Aleksandar Vučić, sending shock waves through his corrupt Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

Student Protests Led by student organizers from over thirty universities and faculties — most notably the faculty of dramatic arts in Belgrade, which began the call to action in late November — the movement has rallied around four key demands. One is the release of all internal documents related to renovations at the Novi Sad railway station, carried out by Serbian Railway Infrastructure, the Serbian state, China Railway International Co. Ltd., and China Communications Construction Company Ltd., which began the station’s construction in 2021. The other demands are the dismissal of all charges against arrested and detained students and young protesters who have been demonstrating since the canopy collapsed; the filing of criminal charges and the prosecution of those responsible for the attacks on students and professors; and a 20 percent increase in budget allocations for public higher-education institutions in Serbia to cover material expenses. Since November, students have organized massive strikes, with such protests as a gathering of over 100,000 people at Belgrade’s Slavija Square on December 22. The protests continued into the New Year, with demonstrators declaring there was nothing to “celebrate” until justice was achieved. They demonstrations are still ongoing, having recently forced the resignations of prime minister Milos Vučević and Novi Sad’s mayor Milan Đurić on January 28. Students have held assemblies and effectively conveyed their message to the media. With a keen sense for Instagramable moments, they have gracefully steered social media campaigns, often featuring overhead drone footage of the protests and eye-catching visuals. Their actions have not only challenged state power, but their demands — particularly for criminal charges and prosecution — offer a stark critique of the deeper systemic rot: a corrupt judicial system that upholds a mafia state and a government that not only fails its people but is complicit in their deaths. What began as a response in Serbia’s major cities has now evolved into a nationwide movement, spreading to smaller towns as well. As noted by Novi Sad activist and scholar Aleksandar Matković on X/Twitter, a map of Serbia showing protests happening across almost all municipalities nationwide shows that the situation is likely to escalate into either a government crisis or more conflict. The events have also sparked deep cultural anxieties tied to national identity. This Monday, the Serbian Orthodox Church published an article damning the student protests, asserting that they were pushing an “anti-Saint Sava, anti-Christian and anti-Serbian narrative and way of life.” This claim that students live in a “parallel universe” was walked back in a statement on Tuesday, which clarified that the text did not reflect the stance of the Church’s top cleric, Patriarch Porfirije. Recently, the protests have intensified into violence, with protesters engaging in fierce clashes with supporters of the ruling SNS party. On Tuesday night at around 3:00 a.m., a group of SNS supporters launched an attack on students in Novi Sad. Many Serbians were especially shocked by a series of interviews widely covered in media in which SNS supporters from the city of Jagodina denounced the students. One older man even said that he would welcome attacks on his daughter if she were protesting.

Serbia’s PM Milos Vucevic resigns as protests raise political pressure - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/28/serbias-pm-milos-vucevic-resigns-as-protests-raise-political-pressure,Al Jazeera English,2025-01-28,"Milos Vucevic steps down in bid to calm anger over deadly roof collapse that expanded into antigovernment rallies.

Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has announced his resignation amid large protests against corruption and President Aleksandar Vucic.

Vucevic said at a news conference on Tuesday that he had decided to step down to reduce tensions. Student-led demonstrations have been taking place since the deadly collapse of a train station canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad in November.

The prime minister’s announcement came as protesters ended a 24-hour blockade at a major intersection in the capital, Belgrade. The previous evening, with political pressure rising, Vucic hinted that he was ready to drop his hardline approach to the demonstrations and negotiate.

“To avoid further complicating things, so we do not further raise tensions in society, I made this decision,” Vucevic said on Tuesday.

Vucevic, who was mayor of Novi Sad in 2022 when the reconstruction of the station was launched by a Chinese firm, added that the immediate cause for his resignation was an attack on a female student in Novi Sad early on Tuesday by assailants allegedly from Vucic’s ruling Serbian Progressive Party.

“Whenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk, … it’s like an invisible hand creates a new incident, and tensions mount again.”

He also said the present mayor of Novi Sad, Serbia’s second largest city, will also resign.

The 50-year-old became prime minister in April after the Serbian Progressive Party won the most votes in elections marred by tensions.

Expanding protests

Protesters on Tuesday morning packed up and cleared the Autokomanda junction, where several major roads and motorways come together in Belgrade, after camping out overnight.

The blockade followed a call for a general strike on Friday that saw lawyers stop work and small businesses and schools close.

The focus of the protests has expanded since November from the canopy collapse to accusations that it was the result of rampant corruption, to calls for an end to Vucic’s reign, which has run for more than a decade, and early elections.

Student organisers continued to demand more action, including greater transparency surrounding the investigation into the collapse and the release of all documents linked to the renovation of the train station.

More than a dozen people have been charged over the accident, including former Transport Minister Goran Vesic, who resigned days after it occurred.

The government has released some documents on the roof collapse, but experts from the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Belgrade said they are incomplete.

Other key demands include dropping charges against protesters arrested at rallies, an end to attacks on demonstrators and increased government spending on education.

Snap vote?

During the blockade, the largely student protesters were offered protection by farmers and bikers. The demonstrators have faced frequent violence as the rallies have persisted, and at least two have been hit by cars.

Vucic addressed the nation on Monday evening, defending his government’s response to the accident in Novi Sad and promising to open dialogue with the protesters.

He had previously dismissed them as being controlled by “Western foreign agents”.

However, the focus now turns to the possibility of snap elections.

Vucevic’s resignation must now be confirmed by Serbia’s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call snap elections.

Pro-government media said Vucic will attend a cabinet session on Tuesday evening to decide whether a new prime minister-designate will be appointed or early elections called.

Opposition parties said they would insist on a transitional government that would create conditions for free and fair elections after Vucic has faced accusations of irregularities during past votes."

Serbia’s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic said Tuesday he is stepping down following weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy in November.

The canopy collapse, which killed 15 people in the northern city of Novi Sad, has become a flashpoint reflecting wider discontent with the increasingly autocratic rule of Serbia’s populist President Aleksandar Vucic. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia despite formally seeking European Union membership for the troubled Balkan nation.

Vucevic told a news conference that his resignation is aimed at lowering tensions in Serbia.

“It is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,"" he said.

Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also will step down on Tuesday, Vucevic said.

Vucevic’s resignation is likely to lead to an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be confirmed by Serbia’s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election.

On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital. The students have been protesting for weeks, demanding accountability for the canopy collapse that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.

        Serbia’s Prime Minister Miloš Vučević has resigned following weeks of mass protests over a fatal accident at a railway station in the north of the country that has been blamed on government corruption.

The demonstrations were triggered by the collapse of the railway station roof in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second-largest city, on November 1, killing 15 people. The public backlash over the disaster has turned into the biggest challenge to strongman President Aleksandar Vučić’s tight grip on power, who has been in office since 2017.

The roof collapsed following renovations to the station by a consortium led by two Chinese companies that are also building a railway line between Budapest and Belgrade. Vučević, a close ally of the president, was mayor of Novi Sad when the construction work started.

The flagship railway project has been touted by Vučić and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as emblematic of their openness to more Chinese investment in their countries.

The nationwide protests have been led by students demanding government accountability for the station disaster. They have occupied dozens of universities for the past two months as part of their action. On Friday, tens of thousands of people took part in a general strike in support of the student movement.

On Monday farmers joined the demonstrations, blocking streets in the capital. With the protests swelling, Vučić appeared at a late-evening press conference with his premier to appeal for dialogue with student leaders, saying “we need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other”.

“Any kind of a crisis poses a serious problem for our economy. Such a situation in society is not good for anyone,” the president added.

Vučić also said he was ready to replace half of the government.

On Tuesday, Vučević said he and his successor as Novi Sad mayor, Milan Đurić, would step down, adding that they there were answering the protesters’ demand for government accountability for the accident.

“The mayor of Novi Sad and I consider ourselves objectively responsible for what happened in Novi Sad and for that we are willingly paying the political price,” Vučević said.

Prosecutors have indicted 13 people in connection with the station roof collapse, including a former transport minister. But student leaders have also demanded full transparency of the investigation, with the publication of seized documents.

The protests have been increasingly angry following the arrest of some demonstrators and clashes with supporters of Vučić’s Serbian Progressive party. The president on Monday offered a full amnesty for arrested students in an attempt to quell the protests.

Serbia's prime minister resigns as anti-corruption protests grow - ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/serbias-prime-minister-resigns-anti-corruption-protests-grow-118170680,ABC News,2025-01-28,"Serbia’s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned following weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy in November

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia’s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned Tuesday in an attempt to calm political tensions and pressure roiled by weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy.

The canopy collapse in November, which killed 15 people in the northern city of Novi Sad, has become a flashpoint reflecting wider discontent with the increasingly autocratic rule of Serbia’s populist President Aleksandar Vucic. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia despite formally seeking European Union membership for the troubled Balkan nation.

“It is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,” Vucevic told a news conference announcing his resignation.

Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also stepped down on Tuesday.

Vucevic’s resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be confirmed by Serbia’s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election.

Pro-government media said President Vucic will attend a Cabinet session on Tuesday evening to decide whether a new prime minister-designate will be appointed or an early election called.

Opposition parties have said they would insist on a transitional government that would create conditions for a free and fair election. Vucic's populists have faced accusations of irregularities during past elections.

Vucevic became the prime minister in April 2024, after the Serbian Progressive Party won most votes in an election marred by tensions.

“They (ruling party) have been in a free fall since the Novi Sad tragedy,” journalist Slobodan Georgiev said on N1 television, adding that Vucic was seeking a “buffer” with the prime minister's resignation.

Vucic in the past had managed to cushion the impact of anti-government street protests, but the current student movement has garnered widespread support from all walks of life, including actors, farmers, lawyers and judges.

The students' call for justice has resonated in a country where corruption is widespread and few feel that the state institutions work in the interests of citizens.

Branimir Jovancicevic, professor at the Faculty of Chemistry in Belgrade, expressed hope that Vucevic's resignation is a first step toward further political changes in Serbia, where power is concentrated in the hands of the president although his constitutional role is largely ceremonial.

“If the president thinks that by replacing one, essentially, unimportant figure ... will solve the problem ... he is deeply mistaken,"" said Jovancicevic. ”This must lead to total political changes because autocracy and dictatorship in Serbia, in the heart of Europe, must be stopped.”

On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital. Serbia's students are demanding accountability for the canopy collapse that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.

Classes at Serbia's universities and dozens of schools have been blocked for two months with students camping inside their faculty buildings.

In another attempt to defuse tensions, Vucic, Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic on Monday evening urged dialogue with the students, who have so far rebuffed such invitations. They say Vucic shouldn't be the one holding talks with them but that government institutions such as police and the judiciary should do their job.

Vucevic said the immediate cause for his quitting was an attack on a female student in Novi Sad early Tuesday by assailants allegedly from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. Vucevic said that “whenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk ... it’s like an invisible hand creates a new incident and tensions mount again.”

But the outgoing prime minister also said that the street protests “undoubtedly” have been organized from abroad “with an aim to directly jeopardize Serbia as a state.” Vucevic offered no evidence for his claims that echoed earlier similar statements by Vucic.

“I can never justify or understand many of these protests, blockades of lives, of roads and the freedom of movement of other citizens,” he said.

Students in Novi Sad said they were horrified by the assault they said was carried out by thugs with baseball bats. They attacked two groups of students and chased them in their car, the students said. Prosecutors later said that four people have been detained.

“We are horrified over the state of our society where such a situation is possible,” the students said in an Instagram post. “We have had enough of blood.”

The students called a big rally in Novi Sad later Tuesday in response to the attack.

Serbia’s Prime Minister Resigns as Mass Protests Rock Country - Balkan Insight,https://balkaninsight.com/2025/01/28/serbias-prime-minister-resigns-as-mass-protests-rock-country/,Balkan Insight,2025-01-28,"Amid growing public discontent over the handling of the Novi Sad railway station tragedy, Milos Vucevic announced on Tuesday that he was stepping down as prime minister.

Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned on Tuesday morning amid ongoing student protests over the deadly collapse of a canopy at Novi Sad railway station on November 1 – and also over the government and ruling party’s aggressive response to public attempts to commemorate the victims.

Vucevic is the third minister to resign over the Novi Sad disaster, after minister of construction, transport and infrastructure Goran Vesic and internal and external trade minister Tomislav Momirovic quit in November. Vucevic said his decision was triggered by violent attacks on groups of students in Novi Sad on Monday evening.

“I think that this policy to which I belong, the party I lead… must show the highest degree of responsibility… must show that it is the most responsible. And that’s why after this event last night in Novi Sad, my irrevocable decision is to resign from the position of prime minister,” he said.

Five students in Novi Sad were attacked on Monday night. According to the victims, the attackers came from the premises of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, SNS.

A 23-year-old female student is still in hospital. Some of the students were attacked while drawing stencils on the bin in front of the party’s premises calling for protests in Novi Sad on Saturday.

Vucevic condemned the attack but also sought to downplay it, saying that “someone was scribbling on the party premises” and that people inside the office “felt that they should defend it”.

Vucevic announced also that Novi Sad mayor Milan Djuric will resign as well.

The protesters are demanding accountability from President Aleksandar Vucic’s government for the fatal disaster at Novi Sad railway station in November that left 15 people dead. Protesters suspect that official corruption or negligence may have caused the outdoor concrete canopy at the recently renovated station to collapse.

The protesters have issued four demands: the publication of all documents concerning the renovation of the railway station; the prosecution of all those involved in attacking students and professors during their protests over the disaster and their dismissal if proven to be public officials; a halt to the prosecution of students arrested during the protests; and a 20-per-cent increase in the budget for higher education.

In an earlier attempt to calm the crisis, Vucic held a press conference on Monday evening, joined by Vucevic and parliament speaker Ana Brnabic, calling for “dialogue” and announcing a cabinet reshuffle very soon.

Amid the ongoing protests, students have been blockading university buildings for almost two months since a protester was attacked in front of the Belgrade Faculty of Dramatic Arts on November 22.

Commemorative silent protests lasting 15 minutes have been held regularly in Belgrade, Novi Sad and other towns in memory of the Novi Sad railway station victims.

The collapse of the canopy followed major renovation works that began in 2021 as part of a Chinese-led upgrade of Serbia’s railway infrastructure.

The works were unveiled in 2022 during that year’s election campaign but the reconstruction then continued until July 2024, when the authorities declared the station had been rebuilt “according to European standards”.

Thirteen people, including Serbia’s construction minister at the time, have been charged with endangering public safety over the canopy collapse.

Vucevic, who succeeded Brnabic as prime minister in May 2024, is known to be a figure trusted by Vucic, who also made him president of the ruling SNS in May 2023.

He was mayor of Novi Sad from 2012 to 2022, when he was appointed defence minister.

His time as Novi Sad mayor was not without controversy, particularly when it came to urban planning. The proposed demolition of the Sports and Business Centre of Vojvodina, SPENS, was abandoned after it sparked public discontent.

Vucevic also has ties to Vucic’s brother, Andrej, and has been involved in legal efforts to show that both men are innocent of allegations of involvement with criminals. He filed criminal complaints about Vucic twice and about Vucic’s brother once so that their lack of criminal connections could be publicly highlighted by judicial officials.

He comes from Novi Sad, where he graduated in law. He practiced law in his family’s legal office from 1999 to 2012."

The Balkan country has been rocked by regular protests in the wake of the deadly disaster at the train station in the northern city of Novi Sad that killed 15 people.

The collapse, which followed extensive renovation work at the station, has ignited long-standing anger across Serbia over corruption and the alleged lack of oversight on construction projects.

""My irrevocable decision is to resign from the position of prime minister,"" Vucevic told a press conference in Belgrade, following a meeting with President Aleksandar Vucic.

""In order to avoid further complicating things, so we do not further raise tensions in society, I made this decision.""

Before taking up an earlier government post in Belgrade, Vucevic had served as mayor of Novi Sad from 2012 to 2022, during which time renovations began at the train station.

The prime minister has been in office for less than a year.

More than a dozen people have been charged in connection with the Novi Sad accident, including former transport minister Goran Vesic, who resigned in the days after.

Tensions have simmered in Serbia in recent weeks with violence breaking out at some protests, with students accusing pro-government hooligans of targeting demonstrations.

On Tuesday afternoon, the interior ministry said it had arrested four people accused of assaulting a female student overnight at a rally in Novi Sad.

- 'Resignation means nothing' -

The prime minister's announcement came as thousands of protesters ended a 24-hour blockade at a major traffic intersection in Belgrade -- the latest in a series of massive rallies held across the country.

Hours later, protesters continued to march at scattered demonstrations in Belgrade, Novi Sad and the southern city of Nis.

The blockade followed a call for a general strike by student organisers last Friday that saw lawyers stop work and the closure of small businesses and schools across Serbia.

Students have emerged as the leaders of the protest movement and have been blockading campuses across the country for weeks.

During an evening address Tuesday, Vucic took to the airwaves to lash out at the protests and his political enemies, as he floated the idea of calling for early elections.

""Our stability is threatened, civil peace is threatened, many things are threatened,"" said Vucic during the press conference, while insisting that the government had met the protesters demands.

""Serbia will preserve stability. Serbia will preserve peace,"" the president added.

Student organisers continue to demand more action, including greater transparency into the investigation and the release of all documents linked to the renovation of the station.

For months, Vucic and other government officials have oscillated between issuing calls for talks and firing off allegations that the demonstrators were being backed by foreign powers.

The government has released a raft of documents linked to the station's renovations, but experts from the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Belgrade say they are incomplete.

Other key demands include dropping charges against protesters arrested at rallies, an end to attacks on demonstrators and increased government spending on education.

Following premier Vucevic's announcement, students who spoke to AFP insisted that their demands had still not been met.

""The prime minister's resignation means nothing to the students. Our demands are clear and we will continue protesting no matter who resigns,"" said Maksim Jankovic, a 19-year-old biology student at Belgrade University.

Shortly after Vucevic resigned, Novi Sad mayor Milan Djuric said he also would be stepping down.

""Resigning is not an expression of weakness or retreat in the face of challenges, but an act of assuming responsibility and opening space for the restoration of trust among people,"" the mayor said in a statement posted on social media.

As premier, Vucevic was officially the head of government in Serbia.

However the position is largely considered to be subordinate to Vucic, who has ruled the country for more than a decade.

Dragan Popovic, a Belgrade-based analyst with the Centre for Practical Politics, said the resignations were unlikely to quell the protests.

""I believe this is clearly a desperate move. They had to do something, to try some desperate measures to divert attention primarily from the students' demands,"" Popovic told AFP.

""I am requesting the most urgent restructuring of Serbia's government because, in these politically difficult times, it has become evident who is ready to fight and who isn't,"" Vucic said during a joint press conference with prime minister Milos Vucevic and parliament speaker Ana Brnabic on Monday evening, as seen in a video posted by public broadcaster RTS.

Vucic added he expected at least half of the ministers to be replaced.

Earlier in the day, thousands of students, joined by farmers and citizens, launched a 24-hour blockage of Belgrade's Autokomanda interchange, a major traffic hub in the capital. The blockage ended at 10 am CEST on Tuesday, local media reported.

The Autokomanda blockage is the most recent in a series of protest actions organised by students since November 1, when a concrete canopy at Novi Sad's main train station collapsed, killing 14 people and critically injuring three others. One of those injured later died.

Students have been protesting daily, standing in silence for 15 minutes usually at major pedestrian crossings in cities across the country to commemorate the victims and seek accountability for the accident. Apart from the protests, students have been blocking access to dozens of faculties at the five state-run universities.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Vucic said the government would meet all student demands, including publishing all documents relevant to the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, prosecuting those responsible, and increasing the budget for education by 20% for 2025. Vucic also said he will issue pardons for all students and professors who were arrested during the protests.

In response to the protests, the government in December started releasing documents linked to the reconstruction. Also in December, Serbia's public prosecutor's office in Novi Sad filed an indictment against 13 people in connection with the accident, including former infrastructure minister Goran Vesic.

Serbia's coalition government led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) was inaugurated in May 2024 following snap elections held in December 2023. SNS has been in power in Serbia since 2012. Vucic, one of SNS founders, has been president for almost nine years."

Serbia has been in the grips of students-led anti-government protests since a train station accident in northern city of Novi Sad in November claimed 15 lives.

""I am open to both options,"" Vucic said at a press conference following an extraordinary government session he attended, as seen in a video posted by public broadcaster RTS. He added that he will hold consultations with all parliamentary parties.

Vucic also said that there will be no transitional government under any circumstances, rejecting an idea floated in recent months by some opposition leaders.

On Tuesday, the leader of the opposition Party of Freedom and Justice (SSP), Dragan Djilas, and the leader of New Democratic Party of Serbia (Novi DSS), Milos Jovanovic, said that prior to any general elections, an interim government must be formed to prepare the ground for free and democratic elections, local media outlet N1 reported.

After Vucevic's resignation is confirmed by the parliament, a new government must be elected within 30 days. If the new government is not formed within this deadline, parliamentary elections are automatically called and political parties are given 45-60 days for election campaigning.

Serbia's coalition government led by SNS was inaugurated in May 2024 following snap elections held in December 2023. SNS has been in power in Serbia since 2012. Vucic, one of SNS founders who also led the party until Vucevic took over in 2023, has been president of Serbia since 2017."

The cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- so-called black boxes -- have been recovered from the Bombardier CRJ700 airplane involved in the midair collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and taken to labs for evaluation, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) spokesman Peter Knudson said.

The NTSB said later on January 31 that the black box had also been recovered from the wreckage of the helicopter. Both aircraft fell into the Potomac River after the collision. An official with the investigative team told a briefing there was a ""high-level of confidence"" that data would be recovered from the devices despite their time in the water.

NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told a news conference that it would take time to complete the investigation.

""We have substantial amounts of information. We need to verify information. We need to take our time to ensure it's accurate,'"" Homendy.

A preliminary report is expected within 30 days from the date of the accident, the NTSB said in a statement on its website. A probable cause of the crash and any contributing factors will come in the final report, which is expected in 12 to 24 months, the statement said.

Former Russian World Champion figure skaters Vadim Naumov and his wife, Evgenia Shishkova, were among those killed when the passenger jet collided with a U.S. Army Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers on a training flight.

The collision occurred just before 9 p.m. local time on January 29 as the passenger jet approached the airport to land. Both aircraft fell into the Potomac River.

U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that several Russian nationals were among the victims and said he had been in contact with Russian officials to offer condolences.

“Our hearts are shattered alongside yours,"" Trump told the families of the people who died after opening a news conference at the White House with a moment of silence for the dead.

The American Airlines flight was arriving from Wichita, Kansas, where the U.S. Figure Skating Championships had been held from January 20-26. The competition was followed by a development camp for promising junior skaters.

The Skating Club of Boston, where Naumov and Shishkova had been coaching since 2017, said in a statement that the two Russian coaches, who won the pairs gold medal at the 1994 World Figure Skating Championships, were among six members of the club who died in the crash.

""Our sport and our club have suffered a horrible loss with this tragedy,"" Skating Club of Boston Executive Director and CEO Doug Zeghibe said in a statement.

The pair, who also won the 1995-96 Champions Series final and competed in two Olympics, moved to the United States after they ended their skating careers, and became coaches.

Their 23-year-old son, Maxim Naumov, is a U.S. citizen who competes for the United States in international competitions. He placed fourth in the U.S. men's nationals, held last week in Wichita, and was said to have flown to their home in the Boston area two days before the ill-fated flight his parents took.

In addition to Naumov and Shishkova, a least two other Russian-born coaches were on the flight.

Inna Volyanskaya, a skating coach in the Washington area, was on board the plane, U.S. Representative Suhas Subramanyam (Democrat-Virginia) said on X, adding that it had been confirmed that none of the 67 people on the passenger jet survived.

Volyanskaya competed as a pairs skater for the Soviet Union in the 1980s. She coached young skaters at the Washington Figure Skating Club, according to the club's website.

Another Russian coach, Alexandr Kirsanov, was on the plane, according to his wife, Natalya Gudin.

""I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends,"" Gudin told ABC News.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on January 31 confirmed the deaths of Naumov, Shishkova, and Volyanskaya, while adding that a fourth person, thought to be Kirsanov, ""may have a Russian passport.""

""Our embassy is in contact with the U.S. Department of State on these issues,"" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told journalists in Moscow, adding that while the Russian Rmbassy in Washington has made inquiries, ""we have not received any detailed answers so far.""

There also were two Chinese nationals on board the flight, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said without providing further information on the victims.

“The Chinese Embassy extends deepest condolences to all the victims and sympathies to the bereaved families,” an embassy statement said.

Serbian farmers join striking university students’ 24-hour traffic blockade in Belgrade - CityNews Halifax,https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/01/27/serbian-farmers-join-striking-university-students-24-hour-traffic-blockade-in-belgrade-2/,CityNews Halifax,2025-01-27,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia’s striking university students on Monday launched a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the capital, Belgrade, stepping up pressure on the populist authorities over a deadly canopy collapse in November that killed 15 people.

Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens joined the blockade that followed weeks of protests demanding accountability of the deadly accident in the northern city of Novi Sad that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.

A campaign of street demonstrations has posed the biggest challenge in years to the populist government’s firm grip on power in Serbia.

Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic, at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, later on Monday urged dialogue with the students, saying that “we need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other.”

Students in the past have refused to meet with Vucic, saying the president is not entitled by the constitution to hold talks with them.

“Any kind of a crisis poses a serious problem for our economy,” said Vucic. “Such a situation in society is not good for anyone.”

Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. He has accused the students of working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government.

Several incidents have marked the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming into the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured.

Traffic police on Monday secured the student blockade to help avoid any similar incidents. Protesting students set up tents at the protest site, which is a key artery for the city commuters and toward the main north-south motorway.

Some students played volleyball, others sat down on blankets on the pavement or walked around on a warm day. The students also held a daily 15-minute commemoration silence at 11.52, the exact same time when the canopy at a train station in Novi Sad crashed down on Nov. 1.

Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption.

Serbia’s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister Goran Vesic has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation’s independence.

The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.

Serbian government coalition holds an extraordinary meeting after the resignation of the Prime Minister - ProtoThema,https://en.protothema.gr/2025/01/28/serbian-government-coalition-holds-an-extraordinary-meeting-after-the-resignation-of-the-prime-minister/,ProtoThema,2025-01-28,"Newsroom January 28 07:58

The government of Serbia will hold an extraordinary meeting tonight, in the presence of President of the Republic, Aleksandar Vucic. The meeting is expected to determine the next moves of the ruling coalition.

Alexandar Vucic will hold a press conference after the meeting.

Following the resignation of Prime Minister, Milos Vucevic, this morning, the entire government is considered caretaker. According to the Constitution, the caretaker government can carry out its duties until the prime minister’s resignation is ratified by parliament. Once this happens, the procedures for the election of a new government are set in motion. If the parliament fails to form a government within 30 days, the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve it and call new parliamentary elections.

Milos Vucevic was forced to resign under pressure from student protests that began two and a half months ago demanding accountability for the deaths of 15 people from the collapse of a railway station cornice, on 1 November 2024.

Vucevic described his resignation as an “act of responsibility”, expressing hope that “normalcy in society and normality in the functioning of political institutions will return”. He said that the reason for his resignation were two incidents that took place on Tuesday morning in Novi Sad, where activists of his party (Serbian Progressive Party – SNS) beat up students who were putting up posters in the city. One female student was injured and is being treated in hospital. The police said they have arrested the perpetrators of the attack.

This afternoon, thousands of students and citizens demonstrated outside the SNS offices in Novi Sad, while a demonstration in support of the injured student also took place in the southern Serbian town of Nis."
"Serbian Leader, Trying to Quell Protests, Jettisons a Key Ally - The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/europe/serbia-vucic-prime-minister-resigns.html,The New York Times,2025-01-28,"Battered by weeks of student-led street demonstrations, Serbia’s strongman leader Aleksandar Vucic on Tuesday sacrificed his prime minister in an effort to calm protests that had engulfed towns and cities, posing a major challenge to his decade-long grip on power.

Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, a close ally of President Vucic and nominal leader of their Serbian Progressive Party, said he was stepping down so as “not to further raise tensions in society” — just hours after Mr. Vucic demanded “an urgent and comprehensive reshuffle of the government.”

A master at maneuvering within Serbia’s deeply polarized politics, and between Russia and the West, Mr. Vucic has a long record of throwing allies overboard, at least for a time, and catching fractious opposition parties off balance. Opponents have struggled to challenge him in elections but have jumped on protest movements led by students and others outside party politics.

It is unclear whether the departure of the prime minister will calm, or perhaps even escalate, the nationwide protests, fueled by public anger over the deaths of 15 people in a November structural failure at a newly renovated railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad."

BELGRADE, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic announced resignation on Tuesday during an extraordinary press conference at the government building in Belgrade, citing ""elevated tensions"" caused by a collapse at Novi Sad railway station in November last year, which claimed 15 lives.

Vucevic said that he will perform his duties until a new prime minister is elected, adding that the entire government is currently operating in a ""caretaker mandate.""

Under Serbian law, once the National Assembly acknowledges the prime minister's resignation, the president must initiate the process of forming a new government. If no government is elected within 30 days, the National Assembly will be dissolved, and elections will be called.

Reflecting on the tragedy in Novi Sad, Vucevic said it has overshadowed the government's work.

""The collapse of the awning at the Novi Sad railway station marked a turning point. From that moment, Serbia seemed to remain stuck,"" he said. ■

Serbian PM resigns after student protests over train station tragedy - Agencia EFE,https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-01-28/serbian-pm-resigns/,Agencia EFE,2025-01-28,"Belgrade, Jan 28 (EFE).– Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic stepped down on Tuesday amid escalating student protests against the government, sparked by a fatal accident at the Novi Sad train station in November that claimed 15 lives.

“In order to avoid further escalating tensions in society, I have made this decision. I am proud of everything we have achieved, of the ministers, and of the cabinet. I also thank the president for our collaborative work,” Vucevic said in a public address.

He also revealed that the mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Djuric, would also step down.

“With this, we have met all the demands of the most radical protesters,” Vucevic said, while accusing external forces of orchestrating the demonstrations.

“Serbia has been under pressure since the accident, and we have witnessed the political exploitation of this tragedy. All of this was maliciously planned from abroad to destabilize Serbia as a state,” he said.

The protests began after a ceiling collapsed at the Novi Sad train station, which had been renovated by a Chinese company. The incident led to the resignation of two government ministers and criminal charges against 13 people allegedly responsible for the disaster.

The student-led movement, targeting Vucevic’s government and populist President Aleksandar Vucic, has been demanding political accountability for the accident since November.

The protesters have garnered support from high school students, teachers, and general massses, who accuse the government of endemic corruption, which they believe contributed to the flawed renovation of the station in Serbia’s second-largest city.

In a dramatic escalation, thousands of protesters blocked a major highway intersection near Belgrade for 24 hours, which Vucic described as “illegal.”

Students have also reported being assaulted by alleged supporters of Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), to which both Vucevic and Djuric belong.

Vucic, widely regarded as Serbia’s most powerful figure, had called for an urgent government reshuffle on Monday, signaling the growing political crisis. EFE

Serbian PM Resigns in Government Reshuffle To End Blockades - The European Conservative,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/serbia-plans-to-end-blockades-with-massive-government-reshuffle/,The European Conservative,2025-01-28,"Serbian leader Aleksandar Vučić addressed the nation to announce an “urgent and massive” government reshuffle that would replace over half of his cabinet. In effect, on the night of Monday January 27th, he agreed to all of the protesters’ demands in an attempt to calm the tension sweeping in the country.

“My demand is for an urgent and massive reshuffle of the government,” President Vučić told reporters in Belgrade after protesters blockaded the capital’s largest intersection for almost a day. He explained that over half of his cabinet members were to be replaced, which would mean the dismissal of over a dozen of the country’s highest-level officials who are unwilling to work and fight in these “difficult times.”

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Miloš Vučević announced his resignation “in order to reduce tensions,” he said, adding that with this move the government has met “all demands of the most radical protesters.”

Additionally, Vučić agreed to all of the demands set by the protesters. These include the full disclosure of documents related to the deadly November accident that sparked the current unrest, the impartial investigation and prosecution of all those responsible, the release of all detained protesters, and increasing public funding for higher education by 20%.

The president hopes that these concessions will prompt an honest discussion between the government and the protest leaders to ensure the functioning and stability of the country:

Because of the state of our society, because of our Serbia, it is important that we begin talking.

At the same time, Vučić denounced the opposition parties’ demands that he resign and replace the entire cabinet with a “transitional” government made up of “non-partisan” experts and activists, saying that power cannot be transferred without proper elections.

Earlier this month, Vučić offered to hold a referendum on his governance, pledging to quit and allow early elections—if the majority of the voters wanted it.

That’s unlikely to happen, however, as his right-wing sovereigntist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) is still the most popular platform, polling at around 48%, far ahead of all the opposition outfits. Images from Belgrade may suggest that most Serbs have had enough of Vučić, but the truth is that the opposition is unlikely to defeat him in an election, hence the current situation.

If the unrest doesn’t subside after all these concessions, Vučić might treat it as proof that the initial student protests were co-opted by foreign-funded NGOs and activists who seek to overthrow the government in a Maidan-style color revolution, as the president suggested earlier, citing reports of foreign interference from the intelligence services.

The latest 24-hour blockade of Belgrade’s most important traffic intersection began at 10 am on Monday. Tens of thousands have joined the protesting students to demand political accountability for the deadly accident last year that started the current unrest.

The university students began striking and protesting the government after the concrete canopy of the recently renovated Novi Sad railway station collapsed in November, killing 15 and severely injuring two more below. Government critics immediately attributed the tragedy to corruption in public institutions.

Prosecutors filed charges against 13 people, including former construction and transport minister Goran Vesić and several other state officials. The charges against Vesić were dropped just a week after his arrest, which caused widespread outrage and the escalation of the student protests into a country-wide anti-government movement. Vesić and twelve others were then indicted and detained again in late December, but it wasn’t enough to contain anti-government sentiments.

President Vučić instructed all relevant parties on Friday, January 25th, to release “absolutely everything” related to the accident, saying the documents prove that the government has nothing to hide and investigation is carried out impartially. The third and last batch of the documents was released to the public on Monday.

On Sunday, Vučić attributed the relentless campaign to foreign actors fueling the color revolution-style unrest in the country because of the government’s refusal to impose sanctions on Russia and its friendly relationship with China.

Vučević resigned just one day after President Aleksandar Vučić announced plans for urgent government reconstruction.

Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević resigned on Tuesday following months of protests over a deadly awning collapse in November that killed 15 people.

Vučević's resignation came just a day after President Aleksandar Vučić said ""an urgent and extensive reconstruction of the government"" was in the works in response to the demands posed by Serbia's striking university students.

However, Vučević said he was prompted to resign on Tuesday morning after seeing reports of attacks against protesting students in the northern city and regional capital of Novi Sad.

One person, a 23-year-old woman, was hospitalised with severe injuries on Monday night after she was attacked by a group of unidentified assailants wielding baseball bats, domestic media reported.

""(The government) has to show ... the highest level of responsibility,"" he said in a public address on Tuesday.

""In order to not raise tensions in the society any further, I made the decision I just announced.""

On Monday, demonstrators launched a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the capital Belgrade, stepping up pressure on the authorities.

Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens joined the blockade that followed weeks of protests demanding accountability for the deadly accident in Novi Sad that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.

A campaign of street demonstrations has posed the biggest challenge in years to the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) government's firm grip on power in Serbia.

Later on Monday, Vučić, at a joint press conference with Vučević and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabić, urged dialogue with the students, saying that “we need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other.”

“Any kind of a crisis poses a serious problem for our economy,” said Vučić. “Such a situation in society is not good for anyone.”

The mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Đurić, is also set to resign on Tuesday. Vučević, who hails from Novi Sad, was the city's mayor from 2012 to 2022."

Serbian prime minister Milos Vucevic has resigned, becoming the most significant political casualty as mass anti-corruption protests continue to sweep across the country.

Belgrade has been the centre of protests against the incumbent government after the collapse of a roof in November in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second-largest city, killing 15 people.

The collapse has become symbolic of wider discontent, with Serbia’s populist president Aleksandar Vucic accused by critics and rights groups of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia.

The student-led protest movement has seen thousands demonstrating against the government, calling for accountability following the canopy collapse which they blame on government corruption. On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a vital traffic intersection in Belgrade.

“I opted for this step in order to reduce tensions,” Mr Vucevic told a news conference on Tuesday as he announced his intention to resign. The mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Djuric, will also step down.

“With this, we have met all demands of the most radical protesters,” Mr Vucevic added. “It is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue.”

Mr Vucevic said the immediate cause for his resignation was the attack on a female student in Novi Sad on Tuesday, by attackers allegedly from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. He said: “Whenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk ... It’s like an invisible hand creates a new incident and tensions mount again.”

The resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election, which may bring an end to the rule of Mr Vucevic’s centre-right Serbian Progressive Party after it took power in 2023.

Serbia’s parliament now has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election – which pro-government media says will be decided in a cabinet session with the president on Tuesday evening.

Opposition parties will insist on a transitional government which would create the conditions for a free and fair election, they said, after accusations of irregularities during past elections.

“They [the ruling party] have been in a free fall since the Novi Sad tragedy,” journalist Slobodan Georgiev told N1 television. President Vucic was seeking a “buffer” with the prime minister’s resignation, he added, as he looks to survive the wave of anti-government street protests.e

The current student protest movement has gained significant support from across Serbia, including actors, farmers, lawyers and judges.

On Monday evening, Mr Vucic, Mr Vucevic, and parliament speaker Ana Brnabic called for dialogue with the students – who have rejected the invitations.

The outgoing prime minister claimed that the street protests were “undoubtedly” organised from abroad, with an “aim to directly jeopardise Serbia as a state”."

""With this we have met all demands of the most radical protesters.""

The focus for many analysts now is how much this will affect the president, whose party easily won a snap election in 2023 but who has come under increasing pressure.

Opposition parties and rights watchdogs accuse him and the SNS of bribing voters, stifling media freedom, violence against opponents, corruption and ties with organised crime. Vucic and his allies deny these allegations.

Mario Bikarski, senior Europe analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, did not expect Vucic to be forced out, in part because of a lack of trusted and viable political alternatives. But he expected the protests to continue.

Serbian prime minister resigns after weeks of anti-corruption protests - PBS NewsHour,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/serbian-prime-minister-resigns-after-weeks-of-anti-corruption-protests,PBS NewsHour,2025-01-28,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia’s populist prime minister, Milos Vucevic, resigned Tuesday in an attempt to calm political tensions stoked by weeks of massive anti-corruption protests sparked by the deadly collapse of a concrete overhang at a recently renovated train station.

The November collapse at the central station in Novi Sad, one of Serbia’s largest cities, killed 15 people and happened months after it reopened, fueling accusations that the construction was unsafe. The tragedy has become a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Serbia’s authoritarian rule and has led to growing public demands for transparency in the graft-plagued country that has carried out a quick series of large infrastructure projects, mostly with Chinese companies.

“It is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,” Vucevic said at a news conference announcing his resignation, which was followed hours later by Novi Sad’s mayor stepping down.

The protests, including one Tuesday evening in Novi Sad that drew thousands of people, have spread to streets and university campuses throughout the country of roughly 6.6 million people, as citizens from all walks of life, including actors, farmers, lawyers and judges, have thrown their support behind the student movement that has rattled the country’s most powerful figure, President Aleksandar Vucic.

Vucevic’s resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be confirmed by Serbia’s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election.

Pro-government media said Vucic would attend a Cabinet session later Tuesday to decide whether a new prime minister-designate will be appointed or an early election will be called. He was expected to hold a news conference afterward.

Opposition parties said they’d insist on a transitional government that would create conditions for a free and fair election. The populist government led by the right-wing Serbian Progressive Party, which was founded by Vucic and is led by Vucevic, has faced accusations of irregularities during past elections.

Vucevic became the prime minister in April 2024 after his party won an election marred by tensions and captured more than five times as many seats as any other party.

“They (ruling party) have been in a free fall since the Novi Sad tragedy,” journalist Slobodan Georgiev said on N1 television, adding that Vucic was seeking a “buffer” with the prime minister’s resignation.

Protests are the biggest challenge yet to the ruling populists

Vucic, who was first elected president in 2017 and counts Hungary’s populist conservative prime minister, Viktor Orbán, as an ally, has managed to stifle past anti-government protests. But the protests since the train station collapse have extended beyond idealistic university students and faculties.

The students’ call for justice has resonated in a country where corruption is widespread and few feel that state institutions are serving the public’s interests.

Branimir Jovancicevic, a professor at the Faculty of Chemistry in Belgrade, expressed hope that Vucevic’s resignation is a first step toward further political changes in Serbia, where power is concentrated in the hands of the president.

“If the president thinks that by replacing one, essentially, unimportant figure … will solve the problem … he is deeply mistaken,” Jovancicevic said. ”This must lead to total political changes because autocracy and dictatorship in Serbia, in the heart of Europe, must be stopped.”

On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital, Belgrade.

In an attempt to defuse tensions on Monday, Vucic, Vucevic and the parliament’s speaker, Ana Brnabic called for talks with the students. But student protest leaders have so far rebuffed such invitations, noting that Vucic’s role as president is officially a largely ceremonial one. Instead, they have called for governmental institutions, including the police and judiciary, to do their jobs and enforce the rule of law spelled out by the constitution.

Another student is assaulted

Vucevic said the immediate cause for his quitting was an attack on a female student in Novi Sad early Tuesday by assailants allegedly from the Serbian Progressive Party. He said that “whenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk … it’s like an invisible hand creates a new incident and tensions mount again.”

Echoing statements Vucic has made, the outgoing prime minister also said the protests “undoubtedly” have been organized from abroad “with an aim to directly jeopardize Serbia as a state,” though he offered no evidence.

“I can never justify or understand many of these protests, blockades of lives, of roads and the freedom of movement of other citizens,” Vucevic said.

Serbian prime minister resigns amid anti-corruption protests - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/serbia-prime-minister-milos-vucevic-resigns-amid-anti-corruption-protests,The Guardian,2025-01-28,"Serbia’s prime minister has resigned after weeks of anti-corruption protests prompted by the deadly collapse of a train station roof in the northern city of Novi Sad last year.

Miloš Vučević announced his resignation at a press conference on Tuesday, a decision he said he had made “in order to defuse tensions”. He said the mayor of Novi Sad would also be resigning. “With this we fulfil the political demands of even the most extreme protesters,” Vučević said.

Vučević, in his current post for less than a year, was mayor of Novi Sad for a decade until 2022, during which period a Chinese consortium began renovations on the main train station in Serbia’s second city.

Nationwide protests began after 15 people were killed when part of the canopy roof came crashing down on 1 November, a disaster blamed on rampant corruption.

On Monday Serbian students, supported by farmers, staged a 24-hour blockade of a major intersection in Belgrade. That followed calls for a general strike last Friday, when many people stopped work and schools and small businesses closed. An estimated 100,000 people attended a demonstration in Belgrade last month, while smaller protests took place in other cities.

The resignation of Vučević is seen as an attempt by Serbia’s powerful populist president, Aleksandar Vučić, to stay in power. Vučić, a pro-Russian nationalist who has dominated Serbian politics for a decade, called for a government reshuffle on Monday night.

Michael Roth, the Social Democrat chair of the German Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, tweeted: “Vučić sacrifices Vučević in order to stay in power himself.”

Marta Szpala, a senior fellow at the Centre for Eastern Studies in Warsaw, said: “[Vučić’s] gamble seems to be that this resignation will satisfy the protesters and help him bring the protests under control.”

The analyst added that an alternative was a snap election, in which Vučić, she said, would seek to regain control of the narrative and take advantage of the decentralised nature of the protests. “He would hope to capitalise on the fact that there is no strong, united political structure in place to challenge his rule, as the opposition was expecting the next vote to be in 2027.”

Vučic’s Serbian Progressive party won a comfortable victory in parliamentary elections in December 2023, but government critics said the vote was fraudulent, while international observers found “instances of serious irregularities, including vote-buying and ballot-box stuffing.

Vučić addressed the nation on Monday evening, defending his government’s response to the Novi Sad disaster and promising a dialogue with protesters. He is expected to make another public address later on Tuesday.

The European Commission said it encouraged “all political actors to return to dialogue and refrain from escalating tensions”. A commission spokesperson said the EU was “concerned about incidents against demonstrators”, after it emerged that a female student had been hospitalised in clashes between supporters of the government and the opposition on Monday night.

Serbia has been an EU candidate country since 2011, but the latest progress report from the commission concluded that “corruption is prevalent in many areas and remains an issue of concern”.

More than a dozen people have been charged in connection with the Novi Sad disaster, including the former transport minister, Goran Vesić, who resigned days after it occurred.

The concrete, steel and glass canopy collapsed just months after the renovation was completed in July 2024, after the station was inaugurated in 2022 by Vučic, who told the BBC it was “our way to modern Europe”.

The government had sought to meet some of the students’ demands by declassifying some documents about the canopy collapse, most recently on Sunday, but that has so far failed to defuse the protests."

How the Serbian Prime Minister’s Resignation Impacts the Political Landscape?
The protests remain largely peaceful but were marred by violence in Novi Sad, where attackers injured demonstrators. Investigations into these incidents are ongoing, with growing concerns about political accountability.

Analysts believe the resignation highlights broader governance issues in Serbia, where President Aleksandar Vucic faces increasing scrutiny. Opposition parties demand reforms and urge unity for future electoral participation.

Serbia’s strategic EU candidacy complicates its political turmoil, necessitating transparency and normalized relations with Kosovo. Opposition calls for an expert-led interim government echo public demands for accountability.

With tensions high, Serbia’s government faces a critical test in restoring public trust. The resignation of the Serbian prime minister marks a pivotal moment in the country’s ongoing political evolution.

Serbian students' blockade protest over Novi Sad railway station incident ends - Anadolu Agency | English,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/serbian-students-blockade-protest-over-novi-sad-railway-station-incident-ends/3464758,Anadolu Agency | English,2025-01-28,"Thousands of students blocked traffic at Autokomanda, one of Belgrade's busiest intersections, for 24 hours to protest the Serbian government's failure to prosecute those responsible for the collapse of a concrete canopy at the main railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad in November.

Thousands of university, college, and high school students began their roadblock protest at 10:00 a.m. local time on Monday and peacefully dispersed 24 hours later on Tuesday.

According to local media reports, a group of students was attacked during the protests in Novi Sad, and one university student was seriously injured.

Earlier on Monday, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, at a joint press conference, called for students to engage in dialogue.

Vucic, noting that 90 days had passed since the Novi Sad train crash, said, ""We waited for the prosecutor's office to dismiss some of the criminal charges as there is reasonable suspicion they committed crimes. If there is no other option, I am willing to sign a pardon for those who request it, in accordance with the law. I'll complete this by Wednesday at the latest.""

On Nov. 1, a concrete shed collapsed at Novi Sad's train station, killing 15 people and injuring two.

Following the incident, prosecutors announced the detention of 11 people, including Goran Vesic, the former construction minister.

Vesic stepped down on Nov. 5 in response to public outrage, and Foreign Trade Minister Tomislav Momirovic did the same.

Authorities have questioned at least 40 people over allegations of negligence during station repairs in 2021.

The incident sparked widespread protests, which turned into a national movement, with students skipping classes to demand accountability."
Student protests in Serbia lead to resignation of Prime Minister Vučević - Eunews,https://www.eunews.it/en/2025/01/28/student-protests-in-serbia-lead-to-resignation-of-prime-minister-vucevic/,Eunews,2025-01-28,"Brussels – At a press conference called in Belgrade this morning, Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević announced his resignation, attempting to quell the wave of protests shaking the country for nearly three months. However, the demands of the population, led by the strong student mobilization, go far beyond that, and Vučević’s step back is unlikely to be enough to restore order.

Serbia has been paralyzed since the collapse of a bus shelter at the Novi Sad train station on Nov. 1, 2024, killing 15 people and seriously injuring two. The incident opened a can of worms about rampant corruption in the Balkan country, with thousands of people spilling into the streets shouting ‘Corruption kills.’ The escalating tensions between protesters and Serbian authorities led – on Monday, Jan. 24 – to a general civil disobedience strike and a roadblock, by students and farmers, of two major arteries into central Belgrade.

Vučević, who was at the center of the storm because he was mayor of Novi Sad at the time of the renovation of the train station while defending the work of his government, admitted that Serbia “seems to have come to a standstill” after the tragic incident, which opened “deep divisions” in the country. Vučević reportedly decided to resign after, last night, in Novi Sad itself, some students were attacked by a violent group, causing the serious injury of a woman. According to the state media, the ambush was a sort of retaliation against the students, guilty of vandalizing an office of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) with anti-government graffiti and stickers. The nationalist party that has been in power for twelve years is an expression of Premier Vučević and President Aleksandar Vučić.

“I expect the perpetrators of the attack to be arrested,” the resigning premier said in condemning the attack by the violent wing of SNS sympathizers. However, providing no evidence, he then revived accusations of foreign interference in the spread of the protests. Vučević also pointed his finger at the opposition, which he said was guilty of wanting to profit politically from the Novi Sad incident.

From Brussels, the European Commission is closely watching developments in the Balkan country, which has been a candidate for EU membership for 11 years. “We are concerned about the incidents against protesters, for which we expect swift investigations by the Serbian authorities,” EU executive spokesman for Enlargement, Guillaume Mercier, said today, citing the attack on students in Novi Sad. “We recall that under EU law, authorities must protect participants in demonstrations from armed or violent groups,” he added.

In response to Belgrade’s vague accusations against Western countries – with President Vučić denouncing from the Davos forum the interference of “foreign agents, from several Western countries” to stir protests – the European Commission responded sharply: “The spread of disinformation and hostile political rhetoric, including against the EU and its citizens, has no place in the EU’s integration path.”

Albeit cautiously, Brussels sides with the protestors, reminding them that “citizen participation plays a key role in the development of a healthy society, including promoting transparency and accountability, values we expect all candidate countries to embrace.” In addition to full transparency in public projects — starting with the publication of all of the documentation on the renovation of the Novi Sad train station — students and protesters are calling for the withdrawal of false accusations against those arrested during the protests and the filing of criminal charges against those responsible for the violence committed on protesters, in several cases people proved affiliated with Vučić’s SNS. The student collectives leading the protests also demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Vučević and the mayor of Novi Sad.

Now that they have obtained the premier’s step back and that Vučić ordered the release of some important documents on the Novi Sad station, students and protesters are unlikely to stop. The president has thirty days to decide whether to appoint a new executive or call snap elections, which could break the SNS hegemony over the country’s political life. The public squares are waiting for him."
Students are at the centre of a political uprising in Serbia. Again - Wonkhe,https://wonkhe.com/blogs/students-are-at-the-centre-of-a-political-uprising-in-serbia/,Wonkhe,2025-01-24,"Today, after three long months of protests, demonstrators in Serbia have called a general strike – and the government has threatened to retaliate.

Activists are challenging the authority of a populist, nationalist government following months of demonstrations that have brought, at times, over 100,000 people onto the streets.

But for me what’s significant about the growing movement – that some think could yet topple the government – is that it has been almost entirely led by students:

The students in the blockade call on the citizens of Serbia for a total suspension of all activities on Friday, January 24… We don’t go to work, we don’t go to lectures, we don’t do our daily duties. Let’s take freedom into our own hands!

It is a story partly about authoritarianism and tactics, and about how power reacts to protest. But it’s also a story about student movements – both official and decentralised – and how they can both lead, and be co-opted, by others.

Back in November, a concrete roof at the railway station in Serbia’s second largest city Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people.

The city is home to the University of Novi Sad – with over 50,000 students and 5,000 staff – and in the wake of the tragedy, a student activist group began to organise protests both in Novi Sad and the capital Belgrade – leaving red handprints at the entrances of government buildings to demand the arrest of officials. Government corruption was their claim.

The group leading much of the activism has been Students Against Authoritarian Rule (STAV) – formed last January from within the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Novi Sad, and responsible last summer for a two-week blockade of the Rectorate building over what they saw as undemocratic practices in student representation.

It’s a fix

STAV’s dissatisfaction had its origins in a law passed in Serbia back in 2021, when the National Assembly passed a new Law on Student Organizing as part of a broader set of educational reforms designed to enhance student participation and accountability.

When a small group of us visited the country last year, it all looked pretty positive – it formalises the roles of student parliaments at both faculty and university level, grants them participation in university decision making over issues like teaching, curricula, and regulations, gives them a formal role in advocating for academic and social rights, sets them up to promote extracurricular activities, and establishes them as drivers of national and international collaboration.

It also sets out detailed rules on elections – eligibility criteria, timelines, and protocols to ensure a fair electoral process. But that’s partly where the trouble started.

Last October the Center for Science and Innovation for Development (SCiDEV) – a Tirana-based think tank that works to contribute to democratisation in Albania, the Western Balkans and the European Union – published a comparative analysis of of student perceptions and engagement in student governments in Albania, North Macedonia and Serbia.

It compiled growing concern about the involvement of political parties in the student electoral process in Serbia, a perception of a lack of transparency in election procedures, a belief amongst some students that the electoral process is manipulated or unfair, and a lack of independent mechanisms to monitor election processes and prevent misconduct.

That’s partly because of perceptions that both locally and nationally within SKONUS (Serbia’s NUS), the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) appears to have played a key role. Milan Savić, who was elected as SKONUS President in 2016 and 2018, was elected to the National Assembly of Serbia as a member of SNS – and activists argue that since then, its leadership has repeatedly aligned itself with government policies rather than defending the student interest.

Current President Margareta Smiljanić has also been linked to the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) through her involvement with something called the Centre for Education and Youth Development in Belgrade (CEROB) – whose headquarters, critics claim, were used to distribute payments for work in the SNS call centre.

If that sounds fairly tenuous, it’s because it is. It may be that Smiljanić and her predecessors have links to the government – but she’s also one of a long line of “official” student representatives in pretty much every country that get accused of “siding” with university managements or government when engaging in meetings discussing issues like timetabling and food subsidies (two key planks of her manifesto) rather than trying to analyse a broader system and reject a wider administration.

Either way, if the SCiDEV report provided a backdrop of evidence, the Novi Sad tragedy provided an event to rally over for STAV – the collapsed canopy a symbol of the corruption they saw as endemic in the Serbian political system.

Serbia’s Prime Minister has resigned after months of pressure from enduring protests.

Unrest has been ongoing since the collapse of a railway station roof last November which killed 15 people.

The railway station in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second-largest city, had only recently undergone repairs. The accident was blamed on poor construction work.

Despite the resignation of the transport and trade ministers shortly after the tragedy, demonstrations against the government have continued.

Last night, at least four student protesters were reportedly attacked, one was hospitalised.

Some of the students were pasting up anti-government stickers close to an office of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party at the time of the attack, according to local reports.

Prime Minister Miloš Vučević said he was resigning “after this event that took place last night” and “in order to reduce tensions.”

Vučević said the Mayor of Novi Sad will also resign.

But even the scalp of the Prime Minister is unlikely to placate the protesters.

Their anger is directed against President Aleksandar Vucic and his government who they accuse of corruption and negligence.

Transparency International said the railway station disaster was a “chilling example” of endemic corruption in Serbia, including in state-owned industry, media and impaired democratic processes.

Ever defiant, the president has offered to hold an “advisory referendum” into his own popularity.

The protests have been led by thousands of students and supported by teachers and other workers.

Serbia is an EU candidate country, but has made little progress towards completing the reforms demanded by the European Union to progress its application.

“It is clear that we need the democratic reforms to go ahead,” the EU’s then enlargement commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi, warned last summer.

Relations between the EU and Serbia have been tense since the start of the Ukraine war. Serbia has a long and close relationship with Moscow.

Serbia has refused to impose sanctions against Russia and continues to buy Russian gas.

Serbia also has a close relationship with China. A Chinese consortium has a contract to carry out railway repairs, including in Novi Sad, but was not involved with the renovation of the canopy roof which collapsed, according to the government.

The protesters are demanding an independent investigation into the accident, but anger has also spread into wider discontent in the government.

President Vučić has previously claimed that the protests are being fuelled by “foreign powers”, but is determined that he will stay in office.

“If they think I’m Assad, and that I’ll run away somewhere, I will not,” he said last month in a nod to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s demise."
Students Toppled Serbia’s Stabilocracy – But What Comes Next? - Visegrad Insight,https://visegradinsight.eu/students-toppled-serbias-stabilocracy-but-what-comes-next/,Visegrad Insight,2025-01-29,"Mass protests, sparked by the deadly collapse of Novi Sad’s railway station canopy, have grown into the largest anti-government movement in decades. Protesters reject elections and party politics, Vučić’s control continues to erode and no political force has been able to capitalise on the crisis. With neither side willing to back down, where does this movement lead?

On 28 January, a mass student uprising forced the Serbian government to collapse. Protests had grown for months, triggered by a deadly accident at a newly built railway station in Novi Sad. What began as calls for accountability turned into the biggest challenge to Serbia’s ruling order in decades.

However, unlike the protests which toppled the Milosevic regime in 2000, it remains unclear how political opposition can capitalise on this remarkable feat."
"Too late and too little: Vucevic leaves, protests remain - Time - Vreme",https://www.vreme.com/en/vesti/prekasno-i-premalo-vucevic-ide-protesti-ostaju/,Vreme,2025-01-28,"Calls for dialogue, beatings, the resignation of the prime minister - all of that happened in just sixteen hours of the Serbian political thriller. For now, it seems that Vučević's ""political head"" cannot satisfy the appetite of ""half of Serbia"", which is in rebellion

Seven hours since the leading people of the state and Serbian Progressive Party called for dialogue, in Novi Sad They were working with sticks.

According to media reports, supporters of SNS ran out of the party premises, chased and beat students who wanted to stick stickers there with calls for a new protest. One girl ended up in the hospital with a dislocated jaw.

Barely sixteen hours after that call for dialogue, Prime Minister Miloš Vučević submitted his ""irrevocable"" resignation, writes DW.

During his address to the public, he spoke at length about the fact that the protests in Serbia were orchestrated from abroad, that the fall of the canopy in Novi Sad was politically abused, and he shifted the blame for the night's beatings to the beatings and those who received the beatings.

The resignations of him and the mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Đurić, show their responsibility ""so that this does not spill over into the streets, into disputes between citizens and divisions in society,"" Vučević said.

""Blurring the eyes of the public""

However, the first reactions show that this move - actually the fall of the entire government - will not satisfy the students and other citizens in protest, nor will it reduce the rebellion.

""The resignation is almost three months late."" The level of tension and violence would have been lower if they had morals when it was time. Now it seems that they are only reducing the visible political damage to the rating of SNS"", Pavle Grbović, the first man of the Movement of Free Citizens, told DW.

On Tuesday, the entire opposition refused to go to the collegium of the Assembly, which was scheduled by the first woman of parliament, Ana Brnabić. The session for Wednesday was completely canceled - where the question of confidence in the government was supposed to be raised, for which there is no need now.

For Grbović, the resignation of Vučević is just ""smearing the eyes of the public in order not to fulfill the clear demands of the students"".

As he assesses, President Aleksandar Vučić is not helped by the alleged public opinion polls, according to which he is still in good standing. ""The numbers are displayed on the streets of cities that did not stand up against the Turks, but now they are standing up against the terror of the SNS.""

It is not yet entirely clear whether Vučić will try to call instant elections in a heated atmosphere, which the opposition would undoubtedly boycott, or, which seems more likely, the ruling majority will entrust the Government to a new mandate.

The protests continue

That there will be no appeasement of the student rebellion is also shown by the fact that new protests are scheduled and that the established fifteen-minute blockades of intersections continued this Tuesday at 11:52.

In the first reactions, some experts warned that key papers are again missing among the tens of thousands of published pages of documentation on the reconstruction of the Railway Station in Novi Sad.

To the list of ""thugs"" who should be prosecuted - which is also a student request - new ones were added tonight, those who attacked students in Novi Sad.

""For 13 years, and not just in the previous three months, the SNS created an atmosphere of omnipotence in which the party structure was sent a signal that it is untouchable and can do whatever it wants,"" says political scientist Dejan Bursać.

""And then they are surprised when local activists take to beating students for several hours in what SNS announces as an attempt to calm tensions,"" he told DW.

He believes that Tuesday morning was very unpleasant in the ruling party, and that a decision was made to make Prime Minister Vučević and Mayor Đurić as political victims, as people who in the party nomenclature ""debt"" Novi Sad.

Although he says that it is too early for assessments, Bursać is closer to the view that the ""dialogue"" train has left. ""The matter could have calmed down two months ago, but now nobody trusts Vučić.""

When and how does this end?

There is no end in sight to the political and social crisis in which the rebellion of students, citizens and many trade unions is opposed to the coordinated machinery of the government.

But not only that - for now there is no way to channel dissatisfaction into the classical political flow. And during the 24-hour blockade of Autokomanda, which ended on Tuesday morning, the students insisted on separating themselves from the political parties of the opposition.

The opposition, on the other hand, as DW sources say, now has no choice but to follow what the students are doing, boycott the parliament and be careful not to give the impression that it wants to ""take over"" the protests.

Protests, originating in Novi Sad, have now spread nationwide, including the capital, Belgrade.

As demonstrators demand accountability for the disaster and justice for student arrests, President Vucic faces pressure to appoint a new prime minister within 30 days or call a snap election.

Vucevic, who served as mayor of Novi Sad from 2012 to 2022 and is the current president of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), said he is resigning after a group of students in Novi Sad was reportedly attacked by four men with baseball bats on Monday night, leaving one of the students with serious injuries.

""The ruling Serbian Progressive Party must demonstrate the highest degree of responsibility [ …] in this situation and that is why I am resigning,"" Vucevic stated, adding that Novi Sad mayor Milan Djuric will also resign.

Vucevic's resignation comes after president Aleksandar Vucic on Monday called for urgent restructuring of the government. ""I am requesting the most urgent restructuring of Serbia's government because, in these politically difficult times, it has become evident who is ready to fight and who isn't,"" Vucic said during a joint press conference with Vucevic and parliament speaker Ana Brnabic, as seen in a video posted by public broadcaster RTS.

Vucic added he expected at least half of the ministers to be replaced.

Earlier on Monday, thousands of students, joined by farmers and citizens, launched a 24-hour blockage of Belgrade's Autokomanda interchange, a major traffic hub in the capital. The blockage ended at 10 am CEST on Tuesday, local media reported.

The Autokomanda blockage is the most recent in a series of protest actions organised by students since November 1, when a concrete canopy at Novi Sad's main train station collapsed, killing 14 people and critically injuring three others. One of those injured later died.

Students have been protesting daily, standing in silence for 15 minutes usually at major pedestrian crossings in cities across the country to commemorate the victims and seek accountability for the accident. Apart from the protests, students have been blocking access to dozens of faculties at the five state-run universities.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Vucic said the government would meet all student demands, including publishing all documents relevant to the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, prosecuting those responsible, and increasing the budget for education by 20% for 2025. Vucic also said he will issue pardons for all students and professors who were arrested during the protests.

In response to the protests, the government in December started releasing documents linked to the reconstruction. Also in December, Serbia's public prosecutor's office in Novi Sad filed an indictment against 13 people in connection with the accident, including former infrastructure minister Goran Vesic.

Serbia's coalition government led by SNS was inaugurated in May 2024 following snap elections held in December 2023. SNS has been in power in Serbia since 2012. Vucic, one of SNS founders, has been president for almost nine years."

President ‘calls for dialogue’ as Serbians block motorway in massive protests

Society
The capital, Belgrade, has been the epicenter of anti-government rallies since November, prompted by a roof collapse at a railway station in Novi Sad, the country’s second-largest city, which killed 15 people.

Protesters, including students, teachers and workers, have taken to the streets in their thousands, blaming the tragedy on alleged corruption within the government of populist President Aleksandar Vučić.

Tensions mounted on Monday when protesters staged a 24-hour blockade at a major traffic intersection in Belgrade, heaping pressure on the authorities.

Vučević’s resignation comes just a day after the powerful Vučić announced plans for “an urgent and sweeping reshuffle of the government” in light of the unrest.

However, Vučević’s decision to leave appears to be linked to allegations of violence against protesters by supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) in Novi Sad on Monday night.

One person, a 23-year-old woman named Ana, was hospitalized with severe injuries after she was attacked by a group of unidentified assailants wielding baseball bats, local media reported.

The alleged assault occurred after students placed a sticker on a garbage can outside the headquarters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), reading “3 Months, 3 Bridges,” referring to their plans to block three bridges in the northern Serbian city where the railway roof collapsed.

Vučević said that he needed to take “the highest degree of responsibility” for the event and step down.

“I wish Ana a speedy recovery, she was given all the medical help;, she decided to continue treatment at home, the attack on her is unacceptable and deserves condemnation. I expect the attackers to be arrested,” he said.

But he also hinted at foreign involvement in the protests that have shaken Serbia, saying: “Everything after what happened, the roadblocks of intersections, roads, bridges, misunderstanding each other... No matter how much we [the government] tried to calm the passion, something always happened according to some dark scenario some invisible hand always created a new incident and further raised tensions in society.”

PM’s resignation ‘not enough’

Nikola Ćurčin, vice president of the Independent Teachers’ Union of Serbia, told TVP World that Vučević’s decision to go was “a way to stop this outrage that will come” in protests later on Tuesday in Novi Sad, where the former prime minister once served as mayor.

He added that Vučević’s resignation was “not enough” for the protesters, who intend to keep on fighting, despite some concessions from the government.

He said: “What the students, teachers, farmers, and the general public in Serbia want is the stopping of corruption and enforcement of the rule of law.

“What we really want is for the prosecutors and the judiciary to prosecute those responsible. So, these protests won’t stop until we see responsibility in court, see who is responsible for violence and, mainly, see who is responsible for the catastrophe in which 15 people died.”

Tragedy that froze Serbia

Key government figures have adopted a milder tone towards the ongoing protests in recent days, emphasizing reconciliation and dialogue, having initially hit out at protesters and alleging foreign interference.

Reflecting on the tragedy in Novi Sad, Vučević acknowledged its lasting effect on his government, adding: “The thing that overshadowed this government was the Novi Sad tragedy, the loss of 15 lives, with two seriously injured. From that moment Serbia seems to have been stuck in that tragedy.”

Vučević also announced that the mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Đurić, is also stepping down from his post.

“We feel we are objectively responsible for what happened in Novi Sad and are resigning and paying the political price. This should ease tensions and bring back dialogue,” he said.

Vučević’s resignation comes amid growing discontent within Serbia over the policies of the ruling SNS government, which has been criticized for its autocratic tendencies and undermining democratic freedoms in the country while at the same time seeking European Union membership."
Vučić hints at early elections in Serbia after prime minister's resignation amid protests - RBC-Ukraine,https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/vu-i-hints-at-early-elections-in-serbia-after-1738130318.html,RBC-Ukraine,2025-01-29,"Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has admitted the possibility of early parliamentary elections in April. This comes in response to the resignation of the prime minister amid large-scale anti-government protests in the country, reports Reuters .

In a televised address, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić stated that his party, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), has 10 days to decide whether to form a majority government or call for early parliamentary elections.

He specified that new elections could take place in April.

According to analysts, the resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević has destabilized the government controlled by Vučić, prompting the opposition to call for the formation of a temporary government.

In particular, the opposition party Kreni-Promeni called for the creation of a temporary government made up of experts approved by students.

However, in his current address to the nation, President Vučić emphasized that the idea of a temporary government is out of the question.

While Vučić's party secured a solid victory in the early parliamentary elections in 2023, it has been facing increasing pressure recently.

Criticism of the Serbian government and anti-government protests

Opposition parties and human rights activists accuse Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) of voter bribery, suppressing media freedom, violence against opponents, corruption, and ties to organized crime.

Serbian President Vučić and his allies deny these allegations.

Resignations in the Serbian government due to protests

The protests in Serbia, which began after the roof collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November last year, which killed 15 people, have continued to escalate. In response to the growing unrest, ministers of trade and construction, transport, and infrastructure also resigned.

However, this did not calm the protesters. Thousands of students, faculty, and other workers involved in the protests attribute the disaster at the Novi Sad station to corruption within Vučić's government.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Prime Minister Vučević, after announcing his resignation, stated that he took this step to ease the tension. He also added that the mayor of Novi Sad would also step down.

According to the former prime minister, this decision satisfied the demands of the most radical protesters.

Additionally, Vučić urged opposition political parties not to boycott the upcoming parliamentary elections if they take place.

The anti-government protests in Belgrade, Serbia, began in November 2024 following the railway station disaster that claimed lives. The protests reflect growing dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the situation and have been gaining momentum.

Earlier, on December 24, 2023, there were protests in the Serbian capital against the election results. These events, along with the recent incidents, have significantly contributed to the current political unrest in the country."
What does the resignation of its populist prime minister mean for Serbia? - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/what-does-resignation-of-populist-prime-minister-milos-vucevic-mean-for-serbia,The Guardian,2025-01-29,"Serbia’s populist prime minister, Miloš Vučević, has resigned in an attempt to calm political tensions after months of anti-corruption protests.

The protests began in November, after the outdoor roof of a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people. The disaster soon became a flashpoint as people across the country seized on it to express their broader dissatisfaction with Serbia’s increasingly authoritarian rule and demand greater government transparency.

Here we take a look at what led to the resignation of the country’s prime minister and what it could mean for Serbia, a Balkan nation that has been an EU candidate country since 2012.

How did the protests begin? Since the roof collapse on 1 November, Serbia has been gripped by near-daily protests. Led by students from several state universities, the demonstrations have ranged from 15-minute traffic blockades at 11.52am, the exact time the concrete canopy came crashing down, to halting classes across the country by camping inside faculties. The students’ demands have been straightforward: they want full transparency on what caused the roof collapse and are calling for those responsible to be brought to justice. In a country beset by widespread corruption and where few feel that state institutions work in the interests of citizens, the students’ call soon caught on. The small gatherings swiftly grew, as residents from all walks of life began joining in by the thousands. Waving banners depicting a bloodied hand – an image that protesters said symbolised the government’s responsibility in the collapse – those in the streets were joined by opposition parties and civic groups who linked the roof’s collapse to allegedly shoddy construction resulting from corruption and nepotism. The government has denied these allegations. In recent weeks the protests have been marred by incidents, including two occasions in which drivers rammed into the crowds, resulting in two women being injured.

How has the government responded? The protests have continued to spread, taking place in more than 100 cities and towns and drawing in increasing support from members of the judiciary, teachers, private businesses and the general public. Showing little sign of slowing, the largely peaceful protests pose the most significant challenge in years to the increasingly autocratic rule of Serbia’s populist president, Aleksandar Vučić, and his ruling Serbian Progressive party (SNS), both of whom have faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia. After a record 100,000 people turned out to protest in Belgrade on 22 December, Vučić said Serbia’s special forces would “throw them around in six to seven seconds”. The threat appears to have been mostly bluster, as security forces have so far not been used to break up the protests. Instead the protests were met with limited concessions from the government, which declassified some documents related to the station collapse. The disaster happened soon after the station was renovated by a Chinese-led consortium. Thirteen people have been charged over the disaster. On Monday, hours after tens of thousands of people staged a day-long blockade of a major intersection in Belgrade, the president addressed the nation, defending his government’s response to the tragedy and promising to launch a dialogue with the protesters. 1:06 Serbian president not interested in 'most corrupt and deceitful' Guardian coverage – video

Why did Vučević resign? Vučević said he made the decision to resign after a female student in Novi Sad was taken to hospital following an attack by assailants allegedly from the SNS party. Prosecutors later said four people were detained. “It is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,” Vučević told a news conference on Tuesday. The mayor of Novi Sad, Milan Đurić, was also set to resign on Tuesday, said Vučević.



The outgoing prime minister linked the protests to foreign interference, without providing any evidence. “I can never justify or understand many of these protests, blockades of lives, of roads and the freedom of movement of other citizens,” he said. The resignation of Vučević – who was mayor of Novi Sad when the train station renovations began – appeared to be an attempt to “buffer” public anger about the tragedy, the journalist Slobodan Georgiev told N1 television. “They [the ruling party] have been in a freefall since the Novi Sad tragedy,” he said."
Where will the student movement take Serbia next? - European Western Balkans,https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2025/01/31/where-will-the-student-movement-take-serbia-next/,European Western Balkans,2025-01-31,"Serbian government fell this week when Prime Minister Miloš Vučević announced his resignation on Tuesday. It was the latest and, so far, the most significant political consequence of a student-led movement which emerged after the Novi Sad tragedy in November. The students, however, are sticking to their original demands, which did not include the resignation of the government, and show no intention of backing down.

In the early hours of Tuesday, 28 January, armed men physically assaulted a group of students in Novi Sad. A young woman was seriously hurt, requiring hospitalisation. The attackers emerged from the headquarters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), which they were supposedly guarding from the students.

The outrage caused by this latest attack was the immediate cause of the resignation of Prime Minister Vučević. This did not change the political balance of power in Serbia, as Aleksandar Vučić still occupies the office of President and SNS commands the majority in the parliament. Nevertheless, such drastic concessions by those in power have rarely been seen before.

“Since the return of multi-party politics in 1990, no government fell due to internal pressures. This is the first time that internal factors led to the fall of the government, which is an unbelievable success”, Boban Stojanović, political scientist, says for European Western Balkans.

He adds, however, that students seem far from satisfied with this outcome, and that they only seem to be gathering steam.

A social movement demanding justice

The movement started to form in late November when students of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade organized a blockade of their faculty after they had been beaten at a street protest commemorating Novi Sad victims. They were soon joined by all faculties of Serbia’s biggest universities, in a blockade which is still ongoing.

With widespread suspicions regarding the institutional failures during the reconstruction of the railway station in Novi Sad, whose collapse killed 15 people, students demanded the release of all documentation related to the project. They also demanded sanctions for all individuals who attacked students since November.

The students soon started receiving wide-ranging support from people across the country, including distinctive social groups such as farmers and teachers. Opposition parties have also supported the students and their demands albeit from a distance, since the students insisted on not being associated with any political party.

According to an opinion poll carried out by CRTA in December, 61% of the citizens of Serbia supported students. While the country has already seen highly attended protests in recent years, the gatherings in support of the students have shattered all records both in terms of attendance and the number of locations they took place.

On 30 January, hundreds of students from Belgrade started a march to Novi Sad in support of their colleagues, who are organizing a protest on 1 February to mark three months since the tragedy. Belgrade students reached Novi Sad on 31 January. On the way, they were greeted by numerous citizens of all ages, some visibly emotional.

“What differentiates these protests from others is that a good part of the people in Serbia are (now) bound by the universal value of justice. It is an extremely strong driving force”, assesses Boban Stojanović.

Now that the movement has caused the resignation of the government, the question of its further trajectory and impact on Serbian politics remains wide open.

Commitment to original requests or formulation of new ones?

As of the end of January, there is still no official confirmation that all students’ requests have been met, especially regarding the publication of the documentation. Since mid-December, the government claimed on several occasions that the entire documentation had been published, which turned out not to be the case.

Vujo Ilić, a research fellow at the University of Belgrade, Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory, believes that, if the movement remains committed to its original goals, the key factor shaping its trajectory could be its approach to the legal proceedings surrounding the collapse of the canopy in Novi Sad.

“Given the complexity of legal processes, this will take time. If all other demands are met, the students could choose to end the blockades and establish a monitoring mechanism for the proceedings”, Ilić says for our portal.

However, he adds, the past three months have brought many new developments, and the students could also decide to reassess their demands and inject a new dynamic into the movement.

So far, there have been no serious discussions on formulating new demands. The students have established so-called plenaries at each faculty, ad-hoc institutions which are steering the protests and which are expected to have the final word on this issue.

Meanwhile, it turns out that the original demands were justified, as the"
