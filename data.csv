The mayor of Novi Sad also stepped down. Demonstrations, joined by students and farmers, included major road blockades in Belgrade and calls for a general strike. Observers believe these actions are part of President Aleksandar Vučić’s strategy to retain power. Vučić, a populist and pro-Russian figure, has proposed a government reshuffle or a potential snap election. The European Commission urged political leaders to reduce tensions and expressed concern over violent clashes. Several individuals, including a former transport minister, face charges linked to the disaster, completed just months before the roof collapse."

DW,https://www.dw.com/en/serbia-protests-whats-next-after-prime-minister-resigns/a-71438997,28/1/2025,Serbia protests: What's next after prime minister resigns?,"Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned after months of student and civic protests triggered by a deadly canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November 2024, which left 15 dead. Protesters blame official corruption for the shoddy renovation work completed shortly before the disaster. Vucevic, a member of the governing Serbian Progressive Party and an ally of President Aleksandar Vucic, said he stepped down to avoid further unrest. The mayor of Novi Sad also announced his resignation.

Tensions intensified after students in Novi Sad were attacked by men wielding clubs outside the governing party’s local offices. One young woman was hospitalised with a fractured jaw. These attacks came only hours after both the prime minister and the president claimed to have met student demands and called for dialogue.

Demonstrations have drawn support from universities, farmers, lawyers, and cultural institutions, with mass blockades in major intersections. Critics accuse President Vucic of running a patronage system, using propaganda and tight control over the judiciary. Though he promised to release renovation documents relating to the railway station, protest organisers remain wary.

While the prime minister’s resignation has failed to calm anger, it is unclear if a snap election will follow or if a new prime minister will be named. Many believe the protests, lacking a central leadership, are unlikely to subside."

Concerned by earlier violence when vehicles were driven into protests, farmers arrived with tractors and bikers offered security.

Protesters marched from various faculties, while some travelled along highways, causing partial lane blockages. They seek full publication of renovation documents for Novi Sad station, prosecution of those who attacked demonstrators, an end to legal action against arrested students, and a 20 percent rise in higher education funding.

The government insists most demands have been met, yet only partial documentation has been released. Meanwhile, 13 people, including a former construction minister, face charges over the station collapse. Although President Aleksandar Vučić called for dialogue, student leaders remain sceptical, and demonstrations continue in multiple cities, with further strikes and silent commemorations planned."

Demonstrators hold daily 15-minute silent vigils — each minute representing a life lost — to highlight what they see as endemic corruption and a lack of accountability under President Aleksandar Vučić’s government. They have forced the prime minister’s resignation and are calling for full disclosure of renovation documents, a 20 percent increase in higher education funding, amnesty for arrested students, and prosecution of those who attacked peaceful protesters.

Rejecting overtures from opposition parties, the student movement has no central leadership or official ideology. It instead emphasises open assemblies where participants vote on actions. The protests have spread beyond Belgrade to other cities and gained support from farmers, teachers, and various institutions, demonstrating a broad-based call for transparency and reform."
