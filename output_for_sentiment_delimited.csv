Hedging Its Bets: Serbia Between Russia and the EU - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPeUFvalBGbU1RcXo4cXE5b1JIdElZVGY2S0NCY09oZlVmWFF2RDNCZVZuRHhXNUkzNkNfc3V4SndfWkJSZHVRRFdKbGZpZGxCNHJDT2hLeHY2bEpTMGFuYm5fREE2MHp5YWo0ajJ3UmstNUFxNHRwaUhMa0FfaHpIXzUydk9HR09URldSZDRJUi0wSUwwWjRIdjJZSVZOQVRlY2pWeEtUTDYzQkdTZGFzTGhxY3E5aXpEenc?oc=5,Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,2023-01-19,https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/01/hedging-its-bets-serbia-between-russia-and-the-eu?center=europe&lang=en,"This publication is part of Europe’s East, a Carnegie Europe project on European policy toward Eastern Europe and Russia.

“You cannot sit on two chairs at the same time, especially if they are that far apart.” Hoyt Brian Yee, then U.S. deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, had a stark message to Serbia back in 2017: Belgrade had to make a choice between the West and Russia. Five years down the line, Serbian foreign policy is still looking both ways. So far, even Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine has not caused Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić to alter course.

On the one hand, Vučić professes a sincere commitment to bringing Serbia into the EU and promoting regional integration through initiatives such as Open Balkan, a platform Serbia shares with Albania and North Macedonia. On the other, Serbia resists pressure to join Western sanctions against Russia and sever its long-standing ties to the country. Flights from Moscow and Saint Petersburg land daily at Belgrade airport. The city brims with middle-class Russians taking advantage of Serbia’s visa-free regime and lax residence rules to move their businesses closer to the EU and avoid being mobilized and sent to the front in Ukraine. The Serbian-Russian connection appears as strong as ever. Yet at the same time, Serbia is winning plaudits in Brussels. “Serbia is well advanced on its EU path,” tweeted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on a visit to Belgrade on October 28, 2022.

Serbia’s Russian connection raises alarm across the region. The country’s neighbors in the former Yugoslavia fear the wars of the 1990s could come back with a vengeance. In their eyes, the Russian aggression against Ukraine emboldens Serbian revanchism and endangers the Western-backed territorial status quo across the Western Balkans.

The Kosovar government, for one, paints Serbia as a mere extension of President Vladimir Putin’s Russia. When nationalist Serbs set up barricades in northern Kosovo and fired shots at the police in July–August 2022, Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti said that the risk of a new conflict between Kosovo and Serbia had increased. Before the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he said, the chances of a new war were low, but then the situation changed. “The first episode, a consequence of the fascist idea of panslavism that the Kremlin has, was Ukraine. If we have a second episode, for example in Transnistria, then the probabilities that a third war will develop in the Western Balkans [are] very high.” Kurti was hinting at Vučić’s repeated warning that Serbia would act to prevent a “pogrom” against Serbs in Kosovo. Although tensions have abated lately, thanks to the resolute mediation efforts of the EU, fears have not fizzled out. A fresh escalation in northern Kosovo, similar to the one witnessed in late December 2022, cannot be ruled out.

The threat Russia poses in the Western Balkans should not be exaggerated. Virulent nationalist rhetoric aside, Serbia is not beholden to the Kremlin but rather is hedging its bets, as it has done for a long time. Moreover, the United States and the EU are running out of patience, ramping up pressure on Vučić to come off the fence. In Belgrade, von der Leyen stressed that Serbia’s progress toward EU accession was contingent on the country’s alignment with the union’s foreign policy. However belatedly, the war in Ukraine may mean that Yee’s warning is finally heeded.

The Serbia-EU-Russia Triangle

Serbia’s Janus-faced policy has deep roots and is reminiscent of Yugoslavia’s Cold War nonalignment stance. Serbia depends on the EU both economically and politically. The union is, by a long stretch, Belgrade’s leading trading and investment partner. Serbs can travel visa-free to the EU, where a vast diaspora has been living for decades. Vučić is seen more often in the company of von der Leyen, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, or French President Emmanuel Macron than with Putin. Serbia is also an EU accession front-runner in the Western Balkans. Belgrade embarked on EU membership talks in 2014, with only Montenegro doing so earlier. As of October 2022, Serbia had opened twenty-two out of thirty-five policy chapters, including the crucial dossiers on judicial reforms and on justice and home affairs.

Yet Serbia’s progress toward the EU is hardly a success. Accession negotiations are moving frustratingly slowly, and after eight years, just two chapters have been provisionally closed. By comparison, it took Croatia the same amount of time to complete full EU accession between 2005 and 2013. This lack of progress breeds frustration in Serbian society. A July 2022 survey by New Third Way, a research organization, found that 66 percent of Serbs felt closer to Moscow than to the West and that 40 percent favored an end to membership talks with the EU.

Along with the EU’s perceived lack of commitment to enlargement, the Kosovo dispute is a key reason for these lukewarm public sentiments. Contrary t","(1) [Serbia]

The relationship between Serbia and Kosovo is fraught with tension, exacerbated by Serbia's perceived alignment with Russia.

While Serbia enjoys a strategic economic relationship with the EU, marked by significant investment and trade, its path to accession is slow and frustrating.

This dissatisfaction, coupled with the unresolved Kosovo dispute, undermines Serbia's EU ambitions. #

Serbia’s Russian connection raises alarm across the region. The country’s neighbors in the former Yugoslavia fear the wars of the 1990s could come back with a vengeance. In their eyes, the Russian aggression against Ukraine emboldens Serbian revanchism and endangers the Western-backed territorial status quo across the Western Balkans.

The Kosovar government, for one, paints Serbia as a mere extension of President Vladimir Putin’s Russia. When nationalist Serbs set up barricades in northern Kosovo and fired shots at the police in July–August 2022, Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti said that the risk of a new conflict between Kosovo and Serbia had increased. Before the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he said, the chances of a new war were low, but then the situation changed. “The first episode, a consequence of the fascist idea of panslavism that the Kremlin has, was Ukraine. If we have a second episode, for example in Transnistria, then the probabilities that a third war will develop in the Western Balkans [are] very high.” Kurti was hinting at Vučić’s repeated warning that Serbia would act to prevent a “pogrom” against Serbs in Kosovo. Although tensions have abated lately, thanks to the resolute mediation efforts of the EU, fears have not fizzled out. A fresh escalation in northern Kosovo, similar to the one witnessed in late December 2022, cannot be ruled out.

The threat Russia poses in the Western Balkans should not be exaggerated. Virulent nationalist rhetoric aside, Serbia is not beholden to the Kremlin but rather is hedging its bets, as it has done for a long time. Moreover, the United States and the EU are running out of patience, ramping up pressure on Vučić to come off the fence. In Belgrade, von der Leyen stressed that Serbia’s progress toward EU accession was contingent on the country’s alignment with the union’s foreign policy. However belatedly, the war in Ukraine may mean that Yee’s warning is finally heeded.

The Serbia-EU-Russia Triangle

Serbia’s Janus-faced policy has deep roots and is reminiscent of Yugoslavia’s Cold War nonalignment stance. Serbia depends on the EU both economically and politically. The union is, by a long stretch, Belgrade’s leading trading and investment partner. Serbs can travel visa-free to the EU, where a vast diaspora has been living for decades. Vučić is seen more often in the company of von der Leyen, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, or French President Emmanuel Macron than with Putin. Serbia is also an EU accession front-runner in the Western Balkans. Belgrade embarked on EU membership talks in 2014, with only Montenegro doing so earlier. As of October 2022, Serbia had opened twenty-two out of thirty-five policy chapters, including the crucial dossiers on judicial reforms and on justice and home affairs.

Yet Serbia’s progress toward the EU is hardly a success. Accession negotiations are moving frustratingly slowly, and after eight years, just two chapters have been provisionally closed. By comparison, it took Croatia the same amount of time to complete full EU accession between 2005 and 2013. This lack of progress breeds frustration in Serbian society. A July 2022 survey by New Third Way, a research organization, found that 66 percent of Serbs felt closer to Moscow than to the West and that 40 percent favored an end to membership talks with the EU.

Along with the EU’s perceived lack of commitment to enlargement, the Kosovo dispute is a key reason for these lukewarm public sentiments. Contrary t","(1) [Serbia]  
Serbia's foreign policy remains conflicted, balancing aspirations for EU membership and strong ties with Russia. Despite professing commitment to EU integration and initiatives like the Open Balkan, President Vučić has resisted aligning with Western sanctions against Russia, showcasing a dual approach that continues to raise concerns regionally. #  

(2) [Kosovo]  
The relationship between Serbia and Kosovo is fraught with tension, exacerbated by Serbia's perceived alignment with Russia. Kosovo’s government views Serbia as an extension of Russian influence, and instances of nationalist actions by Serbs in Kosovo have heightened fears of renewed conflict. Prime Minister Kurti warns that the risk of a new war has increased since the Ukraine invasion, reflecting deep-rooted regional anxieties. #  

(3) [EU Relations]  
While Serbia enjoys a strategic economic relationship with the EU, marked by significant investment and trade, its path to accession is slow and frustrating. Despite opening many policy chapters, only a few have been provisionally closed, leading to public discontent and a growing sentiment among Serbs favoring closer ties to Russia. This dissatisfaction, coupled with the unresolved Kosovo dispute, undermines Serbia's EU ambitions. #  

(4) [International Pressure]  
The international community, particularly the EU and the U.S., is intensifying pressure on Serbia to align its foreign policy with Western interests. European Commission President von der Leyen has explicitly linked Serbia's EU progress to its stance on Russia, suggesting that the ongoing geopolitical landscape may finally compel Serbia to make a decisive choice between East and West. #  

(5) [Regional Stability]  
The situation in the Western Balkans remains precarious, with Serbia's Russian ties causing alarm among its neighbors. Concerns over nationalist revanchism and the potential for renewed conflict echo the violent past of the 1990s, leaving the region on edge as Serbia navigates its complex international relationships. #",Regional Stability,"The situation in the Western Balkans remains precarious, with Serbia's Russian ties causing alarm among its neighbors.

Denis Healey was one of the most talented of British politicians never to become prime minister. He famously advised: “When you are in a hole, stop digging.” His Second Law, since you ask, was: “When your opponent is in a hole and digging, for God’s sake don’t stop him.”

Faced with one of his toughest problems, Rishi Sunak has stopped digging. He has abandoned the stance of his two predecessors, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, toward the European Union and negotiated an agreement to revise the Northern Ireland Protocol. Johnson had agreed the protocol with Brussels in order to reconcile the province’s unique status, as part of the United Kingdom but remaining, post-Brexit, within the EU’s single market. Despite having agreed the protocol, Johnson quickly disowned it. He tried and failed to persuade the EU to rewrite it.

On Johnson’s side were Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and most Conservative members of parliament (MPs). They hated the protocol because trade between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain was subject to customs checks. In the view of the protocol’s critics, this undermined the notion that trade between two parts of the UK was Britain’s business: Brussels and—if a dispute arose—the European Court of Justice should keep well clear.

Johnson and Truss reckoned the best way to assert this principle was to play hardball with the EU. They threatened to pass a new law giving the government the power to rip up the protocol. Brussels did not take kindly to this threat. Negotiations stalled—not just on this issue but on other things, notably Britain’s wish to rejoin the EU’s Horizon Europe program for pan-European collaboration on scientific research. Meanwhile, Stormont—Northern Ireland’s devolved assembly—was suspended because the DUP refused to take part until the protocol was scrapped. All in all, relations between London and Brussels, and also between London and Belfast, were in a Healey-shaped hole, and the digging went on.

Until the last few weeks. Sunak decided to break with the confrontational strategy of his predecessors. He dialled down the rhetoric in his talks with the EU. He dispensed with threats and resurrected two words that Johnson and Truss had buried: trust and compromise. With James Cleverley, his foreign secretary, he built a relationship with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and Maroš Šefčovič, European Commission vice-president for interinstitutional relations who is leading the talks with the UK.

Sunak has succeeded where Johnson failed. The new agreement, the Windsor Framework, was unveiled on February 27. It does not give the DUP or right-wing Conservatives everything they wanted. It removed most barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the mainland—but not all. The deal reduces the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing trading arrangements—but did not end it completely. In short, it goes a long way toward solving the practical problems caused by the protocol. Sunak has also shelved the bill that would have given him the power to scrap the protocol.

The new mood was evident when Sunak and von der Leyen unveiled the deal. They called each other “Rishi” and “Ursula.” The Windsor hotel, the venue for their meeting, hosts many weddings; one journalist wrote that this was entirely appropriate, given the way the two leaders “declared their undying affection.” Earlier in the day, Sunak had surprised Stephanie Riso, one of von der Leyen’s negotiating team, by giving her a small birthday present—as if it was a groom’s gift to a bridesmaid.

The deal has been welcomed by most MPs at Westminster. Labour and the other main opposition parties have agreed to support it. So will the vast majority of Conservative MPs, including most committed Brexiters. The DUP has not done so—yet. The early signals are that it will reluctantly accept it in due course.

However, in terms of domestic British politics, the most notable consequence has been the damage the deal has done to Boris Johnson’s hopes of returning as prime minister. His plan was obvious: Sunak would either fail to reach agreement with the EU—or do so on terms that many Conservative MPs would reject. Neither thing has happened. Johnson has said he will find it “very difficult” to vote for the deal. But he is far more isolated than he had hoped. The chances of his returning to Downing Street look increasingly remote.

Beyond Westminster’s who’s-up-who’s-down melodrama, the large question is whether the Windsor Framework will be a springboard for improving UK-EU relations in other areas. Three are particularly significant.

Denis Healey was one of the most talented of British politicians never to become prime minister. He famously advised: “When you are in a hole, stop digging.” His Second Law, since you ask, was: “When your opponent is in a hole and digging, for God’s sake don’t stop him.”

Faced with one of his toughest problems, Rishi Sunak has stopped digging. He has abandoned the stance of his two predecessors, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, toward the European Union and negotiated an agreement to revise the Northern Ireland Protocol. Johnson had agreed the protocol with Brussels in order to reconcile the province’s unique status, as part of the United Kingdom but remaining, post-Brexit, within the EU’s single market. Despite having agreed the protocol, Johnson quickly disowned it. He tried and failed to persuade the EU to rewrite it.

On Johnson’s side were Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and most Conservative members of parliament (MPs). They hated the protocol because trade between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain was subject to customs checks. In the view of the protocol’s critics, this undermined the notion that trade between two parts of the UK was Britain’s business: Brussels and—if a dispute arose—the European Court of Justice should keep well clear.

Johnson and Truss reckoned the best way to assert this principle was to play hardball with the EU. They threatened to pass a new law giving the government the power to rip up the protocol. Brussels did not take kindly to this threat. Negotiations stalled—not just on this issue but on other things, notably Britain’s wish to rejoin the EU’s Horizon Europe program for pan-European collaboration on scientific research. Meanwhile, Stormont—Northern Ireland’s devolved assembly—was suspended because the DUP refused to take part until the protocol was scrapped. All in all, relations between London and Brussels, and also between London and Belfast, were in a Healey-shaped hole, and the digging went on.

Until the last few weeks. Sunak decided to break with the confrontational strategy of his predecessors. He dialled down the rhetoric in his talks with the EU. He dispensed with threats and resurrected two words that Johnson and Truss had buried: trust and compromise. With James Cleverley, his foreign secretary, he built a relationship with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and Maroš Šefčovič, European Commission vice-president for interinstitutional relations who is leading the talks with the UK.

Sunak has succeeded where Johnson failed. The new agreement, the Windsor Framework, was unveiled on February 27. It does not give the DUP or right-wing Conservatives everything they wanted. It removed most barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the mainland—but not all. The deal reduces the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing trading arrangements—but did not end it completely. In short, it goes a long way toward solving the practical problems caused by the protocol. Sunak has also shelved the bill that would have given him the power to scrap the protocol.

The new mood was evident when Sunak and von der Leyen unveiled the deal. They called each other “Rishi” and “Ursula.” The Windsor hotel, the venue for their meeting, hosts many weddings; one journalist wrote that this was entirely appropriate, given the way the two leaders “declared their undying affection.” Earlier in the day, Sunak had surprised Stephanie Riso, one of von der Leyen’s negotiating team, by giving her a small birthday present—as if it was a groom’s gift to a bridesmaid.

The deal has been welcomed by most MPs at Westminster. Labour and the other main opposition parties have agreed to support it. So will the vast majority of Conservative MPs, including most committed Brexiters. The DUP has not done so—yet. The early signals are that it will reluctantly accept it in due course.

However, in terms of domestic British politics, the most notable consequence has been the damage the deal has done to Boris Johnson’s hopes of returning as prime minister. His plan was obvious: Sunak would either fail to reach agreement with the EU—or do so on terms that many Conservative MPs would reject. Neither thing has happened. Johnson has said he will find it “very difficult” to vote for the deal. But he is far more isolated than he had hoped. The chances of his returning to Downing Street look increasingly remote.

Beyond Westminster’s who’s-up-who’s-down melodrama, the large question is whether the Windsor Framework will be a springboard for improving UK-EU relations in other areas. Three are particularly significant.

First, will the UK rejoin Horizon? Sunak wants this to happen. Leading British universities are desperate to resume collaboration with their European partners. The EU has refused to discuss this while the Northern Ireland deadlock persisted. Now that this ","(1) [UK-EU Relations]

The European Union and the United States have each responded by focusing criticism on decisions taken by the Kosovo authorities. But the EU, and especially the US, are neglecting to consider their own influence over the longer-term failure of international efforts to improve Kosovo-Serbia relations. Fundamentally, the two powers are mistaken in treating Serbia as a good-faith actor in the decade-long dialogue process between Pristina and Belgrade. Kosovo has committed its own errors as part of the process – but Western indulgence of Serbia’s essentially anti-Western foreign policy orientation helped pave the way to the recent violence.

Last Friday, newly elected mayors for the four Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo tried to enter municipal buildings to take up their posts, amid protests by the local Serb community. The Kosovo government had backed the mayors in this move. When crowds gathered, the Kosovo police deployed tear gas and local Serbs attacked NATO soldiers who had stepped in to keep the peace. Kosovo Serb voters had boycotted the polls, causing turnout to plunge below 4 per cent and leading to the election of three Kosovar Albanians and a member of the Bosniak community.

The US had led pressure for the mayors to stay away, and the US secretary of state and the EU and Quint ambassadors scolded Kosovo for escalating tensions with Serbia. The US also removed Kosovo from the Defender 23 military exercise currently taking place and suspended its support for the country’s recognition efforts. For its part, Serbia placed its army on full alert and moved military units closer to the border with Kosovo.

Since 2011, the EU has acted as the facilitator of a dialogue process (as mandated by the United Nations) between Kosovo and Serbia to address outstanding issues between the two countries. The US has always been closely involved, and indeed, in the last two years, American involvement has intensified noticeably: Washington appointed a seasoned senior diplomat as the US ambassador to Serbia, while deputy assistant secretary Gabriel Escobar has made frequent visits to the region alongside the EU’s special representative, Miroslav Lajcak.

Core to the US approach is a major effort to nurture ties with Serbia and draw the country out of Russia’s orbit. Under the Biden administration, the US has held numerous high-level meetings with Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, and other high-ranking Serbian officials. Secretary of state Antony Blinken himself has led such meetings for the US. The chair of the US joint chiefs of staff recently met his Serbian counterpart and spoke highly of the meeting afterwards. In contrast, hardly any equivalent such meetings have taken place between US and Kosovo officials. At this year’s Munich security conference, Blinken sat down with Vucic – but not with Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti.

Progress through the dialogue has been glacial, and the US approach has allowed Serbia to almost completely absolve itself of its responsibilities

The dialogue itself has borne some fruit, such as a recent joint declaration on missing persons. But overall, progress through the dialogue has been glacial, and the US approach has allowed Serbia to almost completely absolve itself of its responsibilities as a member of the process. For example, Serbia is supposed to respect agreements made as part of the dialogue, such as ceasing to oppose attempts by Kosovo to join international organisations. Yet Serbia’s vote in April against membership for Kosovo in the Council of Europe was met with silence from Western sponsors of the dialogue process. In contrast, the US demands that Kosovo fulfil its obligations agreed during the dialogue, mainly the creation of the Association of Serb-majority Municipalities as signed in 2013.

The United States’ approach to Serbia also does not appear to have altered wider Serbian calculations. Within Serbia, political leaders stoke hostility towards any resolution with Kosovo through the dialogue, undermining the entire enterprise. The Serbian public are distrustful of the US and regard Washington as the leader of the 1999 NATO strikes on their country. And the boycott of the municipal elections took place with the full support of Vucic, who also backed the pullout of Serbs from Kosovo institutions in November 2022. This is the context in which tennis superstar Novak Djokovic scribbled “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia” on a camera lens at the French Open.

The US correctly identifies the anchoring of both Serbia and Kosovo in Euro-Atlantic institutions as the key to peace and prosperity in the Western Balkans. But looking back over the last year, the US has little to show for its efforts. If anything, it has created space in which Vucic feels he can escalate crises in whatever manner he deems necessary to remain in con","(1) [Kosovo-Serbia Relations] The recent violence in Kosovo highlights the ongoing challenges in the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, with the EU and US criticized for their failure to hold Serbia accountable for its actions.

Fundamentally, the two powers are mistaken in treating Serbia as a good-faith actor in the decade-long dialogue process between Pristina and Belgrade. Kosovo has committed its own errors as part of the process – but Western indulgence of Serbia’s essentially anti-Western foreign policy orientation helped pave the way to the recent violence.

Last Friday, newly elected mayors for the four Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo tried to enter municipal buildings to take up their posts, amid protests by the local Serb community. The Kosovo government had backed the mayors in this move. When crowds gathered, the Kosovo police deployed tear gas and local Serbs attacked NATO soldiers who had stepped in to keep the peace. Kosovo Serb voters had boycotted the polls, causing turnout to plunge below 4 per cent and leading to the election of three Kosovar Albanians and a member of the Bosniak community.

The US had led pressure for the mayors to stay away, and the US secretary of state and the EU and Quint ambassadors scolded Kosovo for escalating tensions with Serbia. The US also removed Kosovo from the Defender 23 military exercise currently taking place and suspended its support for the country’s recognition efforts. For its part, Serbia placed its army on full alert and moved military units closer to the border with Kosovo.

Since 2011, the EU has acted as the facilitator of a dialogue process (as mandated by the United Nations) between Kosovo and Serbia to address outstanding issues between the two countries. The US has always been closely involved, and indeed, in the last two years, American involvement has intensified noticeably: Washington appointed a seasoned senior diplomat as the US ambassador to Serbia, while deputy assistant secretary Gabriel Escobar has made frequent visits to the region alongside the EU’s special representative, Miroslav Lajcak.

Core to the US approach is a major effort to nurture ties with Serbia and draw the country out of Russia’s orbit. Under the Biden administration, the US has held numerous high-level meetings with Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, and other high-ranking Serbian officials. Secretary of state Antony Blinken himself has led such meetings for the US. The chair of the US joint chiefs of staff recently met his Serbian counterpart and spoke highly of the meeting afterwards. In contrast, hardly any equivalent such meetings have taken place between US and Kosovo officials. At this year’s Munich security conference, Blinken sat down with Vucic – but not with Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti.

Progress through the dialogue has been glacial, and the US approach has allowed Serbia to almost completely absolve itself of its responsibilities

The dialogue itself has borne some fruit, such as a recent joint declaration on missing persons. But overall, progress through the dialogue has been glacial, and the US approach has allowed Serbia to almost completely absolve itself of its responsibilities as a member of the process. For example, Serbia is supposed to respect agreements made as part of the dialogue, such as ceasing to oppose attempts by Kosovo to join international organisations. Yet Serbia’s vote in April against membership for Kosovo in the Council of Europe was met with silence from Western sponsors of the dialogue process. In contrast, the US demands that Kosovo fulfil its obligations agreed during the dialogue, mainly the creation of the Association of Serb-majority Municipalities as signed in 2013.

The United States’ approach to Serbia also does not appear to have altered wider Serbian calculations. Within Serbia, political leaders stoke hostility towards any resolution with Kosovo through the dialogue, undermining the entire enterprise. The Serbian public are distrustful of the US and regard Washington as the leader of the 1999 NATO strikes on their country. And the boycott of the municipal elections took place with the full support of Vucic, who also backed the pullout of Serbs from Kosovo institutions in November 2022. This is the context in which tennis superstar Novak Djokovic scribbled “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia” on a camera lens at the French Open.

The US correctly identifies the anchoring of both Serbia and Kosovo in Euro-Atlantic institutions as the key to peace and prosperity in the Western Balkans.

Former U.S. diplomats said Washington hasn’t been this displeased with the Kosovo government in a long time and pointed to a statement by the top U.S. diplomat.

“The United States strongly condemns the actions by the government of Kosovo to access municipal buildings in the north of Kosovo by force, actions it took against the advice of the United States and Kosovo’s European partners,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

A veteran U.S. diplomat who participated in the process leading to Kosovo's independence says Kosovo cannot take American support for granted.

“This is certainly the biggest break in a long period of U.S.-Kosovo cooperation. This is the strongest fresh expression of American opposition to an act by the Kosovo government that I can remember,” Daniel Fried told VOA’s Serbian Service.

The current tensions rose from questions over the legitimacy of elections in four municipalities in northern Kosovo in April.

Violence broke out Monday after Kosovo authorities installed the ethnic Albanian mayors in offices in the country’s north, where the population is mostly Serbian. The mayors had been elected on a turnout of 3.5% after Serbs, who still want to be reunited with Belgrade, boycotted the vote.

Last Friday, police used tear gas in the town of Zvecan to disband a crowd of Serbs who were attempting to bar a newly elected Albanian mayor from entering his office.

The United States and several European governments have appealed several times for all parties in Kosovo to reduce tensions. And the presidents of Kosovo and Serbia held talks Thursday on resolving the crisis.

The United States also issued a joint statement with France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, condemning the actions of Kosovo’s authorities.

Kosovo gained independence from Serbia in 2008, which Belgrade still does not recognize. Kosovo is largely made up of Albanians, who are Muslim, whereas Serbia is mostly Christian Orthodox.

“I suspect the United States urged the Kosovo government not to take certain steps and our request was ignored and the steps were taken, and the result was exactly what we feared,” Fried said.

Washington has communicated its displeasure with Kosovo by canceling the nation’s participation in the Defender Europe joint military exercise, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker said.

“Kosovo depends upon a very close relationship with the United States. So it is rash and imprudent for them to go ahead and take these actions without consulting with the United States. And I think that is reflected in the statement by Secretary Blinken,” Volker told VOA Albanian.

“At the same time, I think that the statement overlooks some of the U.S. and European Union responsibility for failing to keep some of these Serbian nationalist actions in check over time, which is what caused Kosovo to be frustrated to begin with,” Volker said.

Milena Durdic of VOA's Serbian Service and Keida Kostreci of VOA's Albanian Service contributed to this report.","(1) [Kosovo-United States Relations] The recent actions of the Kosovo government, particularly the forceful installation of ethnic Albanian mayors in northern Kosovo, have significantly strained its relationship with the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned these actions, indicating a notable shift in American support for Kosovo. This development marks a critical juncture in U.S.-Kosovo cooperation, with former diplomats emphasizing that Kosovo can no longer take American backing for granted. # 

(2) [Kosovo Elections] The tensions stem from questionable legitimacy surrounding the elections in four northern municipalities, which were boycotted by the Serbian population, resulting in a mere 3.5% voter turnout. The installation of the mayors has led to violent clashes, exemplifying the deep-seated ethnic divisions and dissatisfaction among the Serb community in Kosovo. # 

(3) [International Reactions] The United States, alongside France, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom, has issued a joint statement condemning Kosovo's recent actions, stressing the need for all parties to de-escalate the situation. This collective condemnation reflects broader international concerns about stability in the region and the need for constructive dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. # 

(4) [Consultation Importance] The situation underscores the necessity for Kosovo to engage in closer consultation with the United States regarding its political and military actions. Former U.S. officials have criticized Kosovo’s disregard for American advice, warning that such rash decisions jeopardize its fundamental relationship with a key ally. This call for better communication highlights the complexities of international diplomacy in the Balkans. # 

(5) [Historical Context] Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008 remains unrecognized by Belgrade, perpetuating a backdrop of ethnic and national tensions. The differing religious demographics—predominantly Muslim Albanians in Kosovo versus mainly Christian Orthodox Serbs—further complicate the socio-political landscape, necessitating careful maneuvering by both local and international stakeholders. #",Kosovo-United States Relations,"The recent actions of the Kosovo government, particularly the forceful installation of ethnic Albanian mayors in northern Kosovo, have significantly strained its relationship with the United States.

Former U.S. diplomats said Washington hasn’t been this displeased with the Kosovo government in a long time and pointed to a statement by the top U.S. diplomat.

“The United States strongly condemns the actions by the government of Kosovo to access municipal buildings in the north of Kosovo by force, actions it took against the advice of the United States and Kosovo’s European partners,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

A veteran U.S. diplomat who participated in the process leading to Kosovo's independence says Kosovo cannot take American support for granted.

“This is certainly the biggest break in a long period of U.S.-Kosovo cooperation. This is the strongest fresh expression of American opposition to an act by the Kosovo government that I can remember,” Daniel Fried told VOA’s Serbian Service.

The current tensions rose from questions over the legitimacy of elections in four municipalities in northern Kosovo in April.

Violence broke out Monday after Kosovo authorities installed the ethnic Albanian mayors in offices in the country’s north, where the population is mostly Serbian. The mayors had been elected on a turnout of 3.5% after Serbs, who still want to be reunited with Belgrade, boycotted the vote.

Last Friday, police used tear gas in the town of Zvecan to disband a crowd of Serbs who were attempting to bar a newly elected Albanian mayor from entering his office.

The United States and several European governments have appealed several times for all parties in Kosovo to reduce tensions. And the presidents of Kosovo and Serbia held talks Thursday on resolving the crisis.

The United States also issued a joint statement with France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, condemning the actions of Kosovo’s authorities.

Kosovo gained independence from Serbia in 2008, which Belgrade still does not recognize. Kosovo is largely made up of Albanians, who are Muslim, whereas Serbia is mostly Christian Orthodox.

“I suspect the United States urged the Kosovo government not to take certain steps and our request was ignored and the steps were taken, and the result was exactly what we feared,” Fried said.

Washington has communicated its displeasure with Kosovo by canceling the nation’s participation in the Defender Europe joint military exercise, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker said.

“Kosovo depends upon a very close relationship with the United States. So it is rash and imprudent for them to go ahead and take these actions without consulting with the United States. And I think that is reflected in the statement by Secretary Blinken,” Volker told VOA Albanian.

“At the same time, I think that the statement overlooks some of the U.S. and European Union responsibility for failing to keep some of these Serbian nationalist actions in check over time, which is what caused Kosovo to be frustrated to begin with,” Volker said.

It’s the longest duration without a new member for the EU and its predecessor institutions going back to 1973. Below, the Europe Center’s Frances Burwell explains the current complex political debate within the EU over enlargement, then eleven experts share their insights on potential new members—official candidates as well as a couple wild cards.

Hard lessons about EU enlargement

During the ten years since the last enlargement of the EU, some hard lessons have emerged for the existing twenty-seven member states. Contrary to expectations, these lessons have little to do with the reform of EU institutions and processes. Instead, they are rooted in political vulnerabilities in both “old” Europe and “new” Europe. Above all, the existing member states fear the emergence of new members—and especially a large new member, such as Ukraine—with serious rule-of-law failings, à la Poland or Hungary.

When the EU decided to grant Ukraine and Moldova candidacy status in June 2022, it was a political decision motivated by the desire to show unity in the face of Russian aggression. Neither country would have qualified for candidacy status under normal circumstances, nor would the existing member states have been willing to make such an exception. But both countries have worked hard, and the question now is when to open negotiations on specific regulations. Prospective members from the Balkans present a more mixed picture, with some governments making progress and others even seeming unconvinced of the value of membership. As the EU enlargement debate begins to heat up, keep in mind four key lessons:

The institutions can adapt. Every enlargement round has been accompanied by calls for institutional reform and treaty change. No way, it was said, can the EU operate at fifteen, at twenty-five, or twenty-seven. Yet, the EU institutions continue to function. Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic and in response to the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has made more difficult decisions more quickly than at any time in its history. The accession process offers too many opportunities for existing members to settle historical scores with potential members, slowing the process. Too often, this is due to niche historical grievances exploited by member state politicians; see Bulgaria’s efforts to slow down the accession of North Macedonia or Spain’s failure to countenance Kosovo’s bid. Rigorous benchmarking of regulations does not prevent democratic backsliding. The twelve mostly postcommunist states admitted in 2004 and 2007 had to meet much higher standards of regulatory cohesion than earlier entrants. Yet today, members of the class of 2004 Poland and Hungary face charges that they have strayed from basic EU values on the rule of law, especially regarding the judiciary and media. Other member states have also had questions raised about the state of their democracies. The biggest lesson of them all is that politics is the key element in the accession process. What will be the reaction of the radical left and extreme right that has become such a factor in EU domestic politics? Will ratification of each accession by existing members be too high of a hurdle? Ukraine and Moldova have benefited from politics so far, but as the accession process moves forward and membership seems closer, the politics—especially among the current member states—will only get harder.

Albania: Strong momentum to overcome rule-of-law concerns

Albania was granted EU candidate status in June 2014. The EU grouped Albania’s accession bid with North Macedonia’s (which was stalled due to a dispute with Greece over naming issues), and it wasn’t until July 2022 that Albania had its first intergovernmental conference with the EU to actually launch negotiations officially.

Albania’s greatest progress toward accession thus far has been its substantial judicial reform, which is unprecedented in its ambition in the Western Balkans. The reform, which implemented serious vetting of the judiciary, led to the dismissal of more than 60 percent of judges and prosecutors across the country who were found to have criminal ties, concealed wealth, or otherwise unprofessional behavior.

Despite this initiative, Albania still has a long way to go on rule-of-law reform to meet EU standards. With so many judges and prosecutors dismissed, there is a serious shortage of officials available to deal with continued criminal cases. And while the reform is strong on paper, international assessments find Albania to still suffer from significant corruption (even compared to other Western Balkans countries) and needs to strengthen its record on indictments in high-level corruption cases, prioritize anti-money laundering initiatives, and increase transpar","(1) [EU Enlargement]  
The EU has not welcomed any new member in the past decade, marking the longest period without enlargement since 1973. This stagnation stems from existing members’ fears regarding the political stability and rule-of-law issues of potential new members, particularly large candidates like Ukraine and Moldova. The complex political dynamics and historical grievances among member states complicate the accession process for prospective members, especially those in the Balkans. #  

(2) [Ukraine and Moldova]  
The EU granted candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova in June 2022 as a political response to Russian aggression, despite both countries not meeting the usual criteria for candidacy. Their progress in implementing necessary reforms will be crucial as negotiations on specific regulations commence, yet existing member states may present significant political hurdles as the accession process unfolds. #  

(3) [Albania]  
Albania has made notable strides in judicial reform since receiving EU candidate status in 2014, with a drastic overhaul of its judiciary resulting in the dismissal of over 60% of judges and prosecutors linked to corruption. However, Albania still faces considerable challenges, including a shortage of judicial officials and ongoing issues with corruption, which must be addressed to align with EU standards for membership. #  

(4) [Political Dynamics]  
The accession of new EU members is heavily influenced by the politics within current member states, particularly the rise of radical political factions. The political climate will significantly impact the ratification of new memberships, as demonstrated by the cautious approach existing members take towards potential candidates from the Balkans, reflecting a broader concern about maintaining EU values and stability. #  

(5) [Rule of Law]  
The experience of Poland and Hungary highlights that rigorous regulatory benchmarks during the accession process do not necessarily prevent democratic backsliding. Current EU members face increasing scrutiny regarding their adherence to basic democratic principles, indicating that the success of future enlargements will depend heavily on political will and commitment to upholding EU values by both new and existing members. #",EU Enlargement,"The EU has not welcomed any new member in the past decade, marking the longest period without enlargement since 1973.

Albania: Strong momentum to overcome rule-of-law concerns

Albania was granted EU candidate status in June 2014. The EU grouped Albania’s accession bid with North Macedonia’s (which was stalled due to a dispute with Greece over naming issues), and it wasn’t until July 2022 that Albania had its first intergovernmental conference with the EU to actually launch negotiations officially.

Albania’s greatest progress toward accession thus far has been its substantial judicial reform, which is unprecedented in its ambition in the Western Balkans. The reform, which implemented serious vetting of the judiciary, led to the dismissal of more than 60 percent of judges and prosecutors across the country who were found to have criminal ties, concealed wealth, or otherwise unprofessional behavior.

Despite this initiative, Albania still has a long way to go on rule-of-law reform to meet EU standards. With so many judges and prosecutors dismissed, there is a serious shortage of officials available to deal with continued criminal cases. And while the reform is strong on paper, international assessments find Albania to still suffer from significant corruption (even compared to other Western Balkans countries) and needs to strengthen its record on indictments in high-level corruption cases, prioritize anti-money laundering initiatives, and increase transpar","(1) [EU Enlargement]

Hard lessons about EU enlargement

During the ten years since the last enlargement of the EU, some hard lessons have emerged for the existing twenty-seven member states. Contrary to expectations, these lessons have little to do with the reform of EU institutions and processes. Instead, they are rooted in political vulnerabilities in both “old” Europe and “new” Europe. Above all, the existing member states fear the emergence of new members—and especially a large new member, such as Ukraine—with serious rule-of-law failings, à la Poland or Hungary.

When the EU decided to grant Ukraine and Moldova candidacy status in June 2022, it was a political decision motivated by the desire to show unity in the face of Russian aggression. Neither country would have qualified for candidacy status under normal circumstances, nor would the existing member states have been willing to make such an exception. But both countries have worked hard, and the question now is when to open negotiations on specific regulations. Prospective members from the Balkans present a more mixed picture, with some governments making progress and others even seeming unconvinced of the value of membership. As the EU enlargement debate begins to heat up, keep in mind four key lessons:

The institutions can adapt. Every enlargement round has been accompanied by calls for institutional reform and treaty change. No way, it was said, can the EU operate at fifteen, at twenty-five, or twenty-seven. Yet, the EU institutions continue to function. Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic and in response to the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has made more difficult decisions more quickly than at any time in its history.

Economic Relations between the Western Balkans and Non-EU Countries - swp-berlin.org,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV0FVX3lxTE9iUnNrdjhLaU5rRG1YT3VGODVyRnlYbXFQV0pXS1FNYzFKNE1HbUdiQkJBQzN0OWY1Wm41WHBkYS1uc1dySElBT01KTEpjUW5nQ3lrb0dSMA?oc=5,swp-berlin.org,2023-07-07,https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2023C36/,"The economic and financial crisis of 2008 disrupted the European Union’s (EU) enlarge­ment policy for the Western Balkans. At least since that time, the region has seen greater involvement by economic actors from non-EU countries such as China, Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Their engagement has been most evident in the areas of direct investment, trade and energy security. Investments from these countries can increase the risk of “corrosive capital”, which could have a negative impact on the development of the rule of law and democracy in the Western Balkans. In view of a visibly intensifying rivalry between the EU on the one hand and Russia and China on the other, the question therefore arises as to how the EU can react to and strategically counteract the intensified economic interconnectedness of the West­ern Balkans with these actors.

Within the framework of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is primarily active in the Western Balkans in the areas of infra­structure development, mining and the energy sector. Cooperation with the West­ern Balkans already takes place within the 17+1 format (after the withdrawal of the Baltic states, now only 14+1), which pro­motes China’s regional cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries. Russia’s investments tend to be directed towards the strategic energy sector, for example in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Other economic partners, such as Turkey, are involved in infrastructure development or invest in the banking sector, while the UAE mainly invests in real estate. However, the economic activities of all these coun­tries are dwarfed by those of the EU, which is the most important trading partner for the Western Balkans: For example, 81% of all exports from the Western Balkans went to the EU in 2021; conversely, the Western Balkans imported 59.5% of its goods from the EU. Similar values were also registered in the four years prior to that. In terms of foreign direct investments, companies from the EU are leading, with a share of 61% of the region’s investment stock in 2021.

However, investments from China have grown significantly over the last 12 years. More than 50% of the project budget in­vested by China in the countries of the former 17+1 initiative goes to the Western Balkans. Around four-fifths of infrastructure investments also go there. Between 75 and 85% of this funding consists of loans, which creates dependencies on China. Rus­sia, in turn, is the largest single investor in Montenegro (based on volume between 2012 and 2022). The United States and Turkey also play a role in road and infra­structure investments in the region.

Figure 1

That the EU perceives these countries as rivals is shown, for example, by the fact that it adopted an Economic and Investment Plan (EIP) for the Western Balkans in 2020. Within the framework of its 10 flagship projects, green energy and infra­structure measures worth €9 billion as grants are to be financed from funds of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III). In addition, investments of up to €20 billion are to be secured from other international financial institutions and private investors. This is a direct response to China’s and Russia’s economic activities in the Western Balkans, as well as the Glo­bal Gateway initiative at the global level.

The fact that these countries have been able to establish themselves in the Western Balkans to this extent can be explained on the one hand by a decline in the EU’s com­mitment to the region. Since 2009 at the latest, the EU has been in a permanent crisis and has therefore had to focus on other issues. This is also reflected in the fact that the IPA II funds (2014–2020) have increased by just over €1 billion – from €11.5 to €12.8 billion – compared to the IPA I funds (2007–2013).

On the other hand, this is also a consequence of the increasingly authoritarian tendencies in the Western Balkans. In the case of economic cooperation, preference is often given to partners who neither demand reforms nor compliance with rule of law and environmental standards linked to EU procurement law. When Western Balkan countries cooperate with non-EU countries, it is also to show that they have alternatives to the EU. Local elites also use the choice of partners as political leverage to accelerate the EU enlargement process, even without making the necessary reforms. However, this strategy has only worked to a limited extent, because the enlargement process is still not moving forward, while the funds earmarked for the EIP have already been planned under IPA III and are subject to strict conditionality. How­ever, this could change in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine if the EU pushes for enlargement out of geostrategic considerations and ne­glects the status of the reforms achieved in the Western Balkans as a criterion.

Last but not least, the political elites also derive economic benefits from this co­opera­tion, for example those in Serbi","(1) [Western Balkans]  
The Western Balkans have witnessed increasing economic engagement from non-EU countries, notably China, Russia, Turkey, and the UAE, post the 2008 economic crisis. This growing involvement, especially in investments related to infrastructure and energy, raises concerns about potential negative impacts on the rule of law and democratic governance in the region. The EU’s diminished commitment has allowed these countries to gain a foothold, complicating the geopolitical landscape. #  

(2) [China]  
China's Belt and Road Initiative is significantly impacting the Western Balkans, focusing on infrastructure, mining, and energy sectors. Over 50% of China's project budget within the 17+1 initiative is allocated to this region, with a high reliance on loans, fostering economic dependencies. The strategic nature of these investments poses challenges to Western influence and governance standards in the area. #  

(3) [EU Strategy]  
In response to the rising influence of non-EU nations, the EU has initiated an Economic and Investment Plan (EIP) for the Western Balkans, proposing €9 billion in grants for green energy and infrastructure. This plan represents a strategic counter to the economic activities of China and Russia, emphasizing the EU's need to re-establish its commitment to the region amidst increasing geopolitical competition. #  

(4) [Political Elites]  
Local political elites in the Western Balkans are leveraging partnerships with non-EU countries to enhance their political capital, often choosing economic collaborations that bypass EU standards and reforms. This strategy serves to demonstrate alternatives to EU integration, though it has not significantly advanced the enlargement process, which remains stalled despite growing EU aspirations to counterbalance Russia’s actions. #

At least since that time, the region has seen greater involvement by economic actors from non-EU countries such as China, Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Their engagement has been most evident in the areas of direct investment, trade and energy security. Investments from these countries can increase the risk of “corrosive capital”, which could have a negative impact on the development of the rule of law and democracy in the Western Balkans. In view of a visibly intensifying rivalry between the EU on the one hand and Russia and China on the other, the question therefore arises as to how the EU can react to and strategically counteract the intensified economic interconnectedness of the West­ern Balkans with these actors.

Within the framework of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is primarily active in the Western Balkans in the areas of infra­structure development, mining and the energy sector. Cooperation with the West­ern Balkans already takes place within the 17+1 format (after the withdrawal of the Baltic states, now only 14+1), which pro­motes China’s regional cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries. Russia’s investments tend to be directed towards the strategic energy sector, for example in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Other economic partners, such as Turkey, are involved in infrastructure development or invest in the banking sector, while the UAE mainly invests in real estate. However, the economic activities of all these coun­tries are dwarfed by those of the EU, which is the most important trading partner for the Western Balkans: For example, 81% of all exports from the Western Balkans went to the EU in 2021; conversely, the Western Balkans imported 59.5% of its goods from the EU. Similar values were also registered in the four years prior to that. In terms of foreign direct investments, companies from the EU are leading, with a share of 61% of the region’s investment stock in 2021.

However, investments from China have grown significantly over the last 12 years. More than 50% of the project budget in­vested by China in the countries of the former 17+1 initiative goes to the Western Balkans. Around four-fifths of infrastructure investments also go there. Between 75 and 85% of this funding consists of loans, which creates dependencies on China. Rus­sia, in turn, is the largest single investor in Montenegro (based on volume between 2012 and 2022). The United States and Turkey also play a role in road and infra­structure investments in the region.

That the EU perceives these countries as rivals is shown, for example, by the fact that it adopted an Economic and Investment Plan (EIP) for the Western Balkans in 2020. Within the framework of its 10 flagship projects, green energy and infra­structure measures worth €9 billion as grants are to be financed from funds of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III). In addition, investments of up to €20 billion are to be secured from other international financial institutions and private investors. This is a direct response to China’s and Russia’s economic activities in the Western Balkans, as well as the Glo­bal Gateway initiative at the global level.

The fact that these countries have been able to establish themselves in the Western Balkans to this extent can be explained on the one hand by a decline in the EU’s com­mitment to the region. Since 2009 at the latest, the EU has been in a permanent crisis and has therefore had to focus on other issues. This is also reflected in the fact that the IPA II funds (2014–2020) have increased by just over €1 billion – from €11.5 to €12.8 billion – compared to the IPA I funds (2007–2013).

On the other hand, this is also a consequence of the increasingly authoritarian tendencies in the Western Balkans. In the case of economic cooperation, preference is often given to partners who neither demand reforms nor compliance with rule of law and environmental standards linked to EU procurement law. When Western Balkan countries cooperate with non-EU countries, it is also to show that they have alternatives to the EU. Local elites also use the choice of partners as political leverage to accelerate the EU enlargement process, even without making the necessary reforms. However, this strategy has only worked to a limited extent, because the enlargement process is still not moving forward, while the funds earmarked for the EIP have already been planned under IPA III and are subject to strict conditionality. How­ever, this could change in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine if the EU pushes for enlargement out of geostrategic considerations and ne­glects the status of the reforms achieved in the Western Balkans as a criterion.

Rather than being squeezed between East and West, Serbia under Aleksandar Vučić pursues ambiguity to secure power domestically and maximize maneuvering space internationally.

At the beginning of March 2022, when demonstrations against Russian aggression in Ukraine broke out across Europe, several thousand demonstrators gathered in Belgrade to support Russia. The demonstrators moved from the monument of Tsar Nikola II to the Russian and Belarusian embassies. In addition to the slogan “Serbia and Russia do not need the [European] Union,” the demonstrators displayed the letter “Z” (the symbol of the Russian invasion), Orthodox icons, and Serbian and Russian flags. The demonstrators also criticized the Serbian government, accusing it of treason for insufficient support to Russia–despite Serbia’s opposition to sanctions against Russia. In the coming months, small far-right groups organized numerous protests. Putin has been the most popular international politician in Serbia even after the start of the Ukrainian War. 84.8 percent of Serbs also blame NATO for the war in Ukraine. Despite these pro-Russia views, most Serbs do not want complete alignment with Russia. Rather, they prefer to keep a distance from both the West (the European Union and the United States) and Russia.

Serbia Squeezed between Russia and the West?

Under Vučić, Serbia has sought to maintain friendly relations with both Russia and the West since the beginning of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Serbia’s contradictory foreign policy has involved condemning Russian aggression and selling weapons to Ukraine while not imposing sanctions against Russia. Since the outbreak of the war, Serbia’s president and government have repeatedly claimed that they are beset by both East and West. For example, in August 2022, responding to a demonstration against Europride, Vučić told Reuters that he believed that a proxy conflict between the East and the West was taking place in Serbia. Various media outlets also readily adopted this narrative. Depending on the situation, Vučić presents himself as a victim of the great powers or a skillful juggler on the world stage to secure power. Vučić could have used Russian aggression against Ukraine to distance himself from Russia: ultimately, Russian aggression threatens Ukrainian sovereignty just as Kosovo’s independence supposedly threatens Serbia’s sovereignty. The Serbian government, however, maintains a deliberate ambivalence, maintaining amicable relations with Russia while also condemning attacks on Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

To the surprise of many, Serbia joined in condemning Russia at the United Nations General Assembly on March 2, 2022. In April 2022, Serbia again supported a vote to suspend Russia in the United Nations Human Rights Council. Far-right groups accused the Serbian government of “treason” after this vote. Further tensions emerged when media reports suggested Serbia delivered weapons to Ukraine. These weapon deliveries were confirmed in the US intelligence materials uncovered in April 2023.

Despite these tensions with Russia, the Serbian government did not support any of the sanctions imposed by the EU, the United States, or the United Kingdom, citing its historical sufferings from sanctions. In addition, Serbia’s dependence on Russian energy, especially gas, meant that Serbia could not risk joining Western powers by imposing sanctions.

The apparent divergence between Serbian and EU foreign policies existed long before Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Serbia has maintained good relations with Russia and China since the late 2000s. After Kosovo became independent, Serbian President Boris Tadić announced in 2009 that Serbia’s foreign policy was based on four pillars: good relations with the EU, the United States, China, and Russia. Aleksandar Vučić has perfected this foreign policy ambivalence.

Serbia’s geopolitical ambivalence is not only a part of the regime’s foreign policy but also deeply embedded domestically. Government-controlled media have deliberately promoted anti-Western attitudes since Vučić came to power. Russia and China as well as their presidents, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, appear in an overwhelmingly positive light. Furthermore, the media stages a constant threat against Serbia: the tabloids have warned almost daily of an imminent war against Serbia—pointing fingers towards either neighboring states or the West—for years. This distorted portrayal of reality presents Serbia and its people as victims of global and regional conspiracies.

Historically, Serbia has maintained strong ties with both Russia and China since the late 2000s, a strategy initiated by former President Boris Tadić. This geopolitical ambivalence has persisted under Vučić, who skillfully navigates between these powers while also engaging with the EU and the US. Serbia's reliance on Russian energy resources complicates its potential alignment with Western sanctions, further entrenching its ambivalent stance in international relations. #  

(5) [International Relations]  
Despite its contradictory actions, Serbia has occasionally aligned with Western positions, such as condemning Russia at the UN and voting to suspend it from the Human Rights Council. These actions have sparked backlash from far-right groups within Serbia, who accuse the government of treason, highlighting the domestic tensions arising from Serbia’s dual foreign policy approach. This reflects the challenges Serbia faces in balancing its international commitments with internal political pressures. #",International Relations,"Despite its contradictory actions, Serbia has occasionally aligned with Western positions, such as condemning Russia at the UN and voting to suspend it from the Human Rights Council.

The signatories asked for balance and proportionality in dealing with Kosovo and Serbia. Noting that Kosovo has faced significant repercussions following the efforts by Mayors to enter their offices in Northern Kosovo in May, they said that the lack of pressure placed on Serbia following the arbitrary detention of three Kosovo police officers and failure to hold to account those responsible for attacks on KFOR, “highlights the current lack of even-handedness in addressing such flash points”.

The letter states that the current approach towards Kosovo and Serbia is not working and asked the international community not to accept a “Belgrade-centered policy for the Balkans”.

“We also ask that you consider adopting a policy of deterrence diplomacy to prevent further aggravation of the security and political situation in the north of Kosovo, with balance and proportionality guiding any statements and any punishments or sanctions issued and that those who do uphold the rule of law and democracy are not scolded”, the letter concludes.

The signatories include Alicia Kearns, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the UK Parliament, Bob Menendez, Chair of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Michael Roth, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of German Bundestag, together with their counterparts from the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Ireland, Lithuania, Letonia, Estonia and Iceland.

(2) [Serbia]  
The letter criticizes the lack of accountability for Serbia concerning the detention of Kosovo police officers and attacks on KFOR, suggesting that this reflects a bias in how the international community addresses tensions in the region. It advocates for a more even-handed approach that does not disproportionately penalize one side over the other. #

The call for ""deterrence diplomacy"" underscores the need for proactive measures to prevent further deterioration of relations and to ensure that the principles of rule of law and democracy are upheld consistently across both Kosovo and Serbia. The signatories advocate for policies that reflect fairness in international responses to conflicts in the Balkans. #

The letter is backed by a coalition of influential political figures from several countries, indicating a significant level of bipartisan support for a reassessment of the diplomatic approach to the Balkans.

Is the West Changing Its Policy on Serbia? - Voice of America English News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQRm9JSWxZeHM2S3ZrLWtRUkhCbk9NM1lMeEkzSnI2bEJwMHZjWGczVUNNc19HMDZ6RldIcnVyckhERHZSTEFzMEg3RzROSGtUdFlkNEdsOC0zbkpEQjFQZXItekh5MC0tbTM2VkdzU0FLSzVjQ2FhNnAtZm5mdkxpbVZ1UW4xZ0950gGLAUFVX3lxTE56Ulk3LUFXcnJOU3hGeDlFUlYyOEU0T2pPcmllMnVYSEpZNGctcGpZT1F1SVZiVzJuemlVVWRqS0dOZnp0TzhsNzYwOFBwQWk4ekdnR2RQTmhpcjlCWjM4NUhxLTNWdmUteHc4eDdJcW5zVHh3eE9fQkJtUmpBRVFLcjZRMWV5cXctY0U?oc=5,Voice of America English News,2023-09-01,https://www.voanews.com/a/is-the-west-changing-its-policy-on-serbia-/7250494.html,"In July, a group of 56 European and American lawmakers sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and U.K. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, demanding a tougher Western policy toward Serbia, primarily regarding its relations with Kosovo.

“We are asking for balance and proportionality to return in dealing with Kosovo and Serbia,” the Western officials wrote, adding that the current approach is not working.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence, which it declared in 2008, and tensions have been a constant between the two countries since then. This year, there have been several flare-ups in northern Kosovo, where the ethnic Serbs are a majority of the population.

The letter was followed by articles in U.S. and German media outlets, such as CNN and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, criticizing the West for perceived appeasement of Serbia, a Western Balkan country that the United States and its allies hope to persuade to join in sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine.

For Richard Kraemer, a fellow at the U.S. Foreign Policy Research Institute, the Western media coverage is no surprise: “These modest displays of discontent with Belgrade indicate that certain Western leaders are fed up with [Serbian President Aleksandar] Vucic’s manipulative shenanigans.”

On the other hand, Bodo Weber, political analyst and senior associate at the Democratization Policy Council in Berlin, said he does not see the letter as evidence that the West is changing course toward Serbia or Vucic.

“That change would be welcome, but unfortunately, we don't see such a turnaround in sight. Rather, the letter of a few Western parliamentarians attracted the attention of the Western media, which normally rarely write about the region,"" Weber said in a written response to questions from VOA.

During a press conference in Belgrade at the beginning of August, Vucic claimed that he personally — and not the country — is being criticized for not recognizing the independence of Kosovo and for “defending the interests of the Serbian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.”

U.S. Ambassador to Belgrade Christopher Hill defended the U.S. approach to relations with Vucic’s government in an exclusive interview with VOA’s Serbian Service.

“You have policies not just for success but because they are the right policies to have,” Hill said. “We weigh our interest in formulating a policy, and we proceed with it on the idea that this is the right thing for our government to do.”

Belgrade’s ties with Russia

Serbia is formally seeking EU membership and has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations, yet it has maintained its historically friendly relations with Moscow.

“Everyone should join sanctions, certainly countries aspiring to join Europe,” Hill said. “We think that is the right thing to do and would like to see Serbia do the same and march toward Euro-Atlantic systems.”

In a statement provided through a Washington public relations firm, Serbian Ambassador to Washington Marko Djuric stressed his country’s commitment “to playing a positive role in the region, and to improving our ties within these alliances.”

“Serbia is devoted to becoming a member of the European Union and has repeatedly voted for United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and affirming the latter's territorial sovereignty,” the statement said.

Johanna Deimel, a German expert on the Balkans, pointed to published reports, based on a leaked U.S. intelligence document, that Serbia has quietly agreed to provide arms to Ukraine for its defense against the Russian invasion.

“On one hand, Belgrade has been criticized for refusing to join the EU sanctions against Russia, and on the other hand, it seems that, for example, arms deliveries to Ukraine are helping to turn a blind eye elsewhere,"" she said.

She also said efforts to align Serbia more closely with the West are complicated by Russian influence in the region’s media and its investments in the energy sector in the Balkans.

Kraemer noted that Serbia is almost entirely dependent on natural gas supplies from Russia and maintains trade and military ties with Moscow, while pro-Russian sentiments are high in the country.

The West ""has bent over backwards to try and lure Belgrade into the transatlantic fold with carrots while looking from the sidelines at Serbia’s proxy status vis-a-vis the Kremlin’s Balkan agenda,” he said.

“Why they thought this would work, considering Vucic’s overt refusal to get on board concerning Ukraine, remains a mystery to me.”

In the July letter, the U.S. and EU lawmakers criticized Vucic for close ties and support to Milorad Dodik, the nationalist president of the Republic of Srpska in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dodik has been sanctioned by the United States for “undermining the Dayton peace accords,” a U.S.-sponsored agreement that ended the Balkan war in the 1990s.

Another obstacle","(1) [Serbia-Kosovo Relations]  
Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo's independence has led to ongoing tensions, exacerbated by recent flare-ups in northern Kosovo. A letter from Western lawmakers to key U.S. and EU officials called for a reassessment of policies towards Serbia, indicating dissatisfaction with the current approach. The letter emphasizes a need for balance in dealing with both Serbia and Kosovo. #  

(2) [Western Policy Critique]  
The media coverage from U.S. and German outlets has criticized the West for its perceived leniency towards Serbia, particularly regarding its stance on sanctions against Russia. Analysts suggest that some Western leaders are growing frustrated with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's approach, but there is skepticism about any imminent policy shift towards Serbia. #  

(3) [Serbia's EU Aspirations]  
Despite formally seeking EU membership and condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the UN, Serbia continues to maintain strong ties with Moscow. U.S. officials express the expectation that Serbia should align itself with EU sanctions, stressing that aspiring EU members should adhere to Euro-Atlantic policies. #  

(4) [Military and Economic Ties to Russia]  
Serbia's dependency on Russian natural gas and its military and trade relationships with Moscow complicate its Western integration efforts. Analysts express concern over Serbia's potential arms support to Ukraine while simultaneously refusing to join EU sanctions against Russia, indicating a complex balancing act in its foreign policy. #  

(5) [Internal and Regional Tensions]

“We are asking for balance and proportionality to return in dealing with Kosovo and Serbia,” the Western officials wrote, adding that the current approach is not working.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence, which it declared in 2008, and tensions have been a constant between the two countries since then. This year, there have been several flare-ups in northern Kosovo, where the ethnic Serbs are a majority of the population.

The letter was followed by articles in U.S. and German media outlets, such as CNN and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, criticizing the West for perceived appeasement of Serbia, a Western Balkan country that the United States and its allies hope to persuade to join in sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine.

For Richard Kraemer, a fellow at the U.S. Foreign Policy Research Institute, the Western media coverage is no surprise: “These modest displays of discontent with Belgrade indicate that certain Western leaders are fed up with [Serbian President Aleksandar] Vucic’s manipulative shenanigans.”

On the other hand, Bodo Weber, political analyst and senior associate at the Democratization Policy Council in Berlin, said he does not see the letter as evidence that the West is changing course toward Serbia or Vucic.

“That change would be welcome, but unfortunately, we don't see such a turnaround in sight. Rather, the letter of a few Western parliamentarians attracted the attention of the Western media, which normally rarely write about the region,"" Weber said in a written response to questions from VOA.

During a press conference in Belgrade at the beginning of August, Vucic claimed that he personally — and not the country — is being criticized for not recognizing the independence of Kosovo and for “defending the interests of the Serbian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.”

U.S. Ambassador to Belgrade Christopher Hill defended the U.S. approach to relations with Vucic’s government in an exclusive interview with VOA’s Serbian Service.

“You have policies not just for success but because they are the right policies to have,” Hill said. “We weigh our interest in formulating a policy, and we proceed with it on the idea that this is the right thing for our government to do.”

Belgrade’s ties with Russia

Serbia is formally seeking EU membership and has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations, yet it has maintained its historically friendly relations with Moscow.

“Everyone should join sanctions, certainly countries aspiring to join Europe,” Hill said. “We think that is the right thing to do and would like to see Serbia do the same and march toward Euro-Atlantic systems.”

In a statement provided through a Washington public relations firm, Serbian Ambassador to Washington Marko Djuric stressed his country’s commitment “to playing a positive role in the region, and to improving our ties within these alliances.”

“Serbia is devoted to becoming a member of the European Union and has repeatedly voted for United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and affirming the latter's territorial sovereignty,” the statement said.

Johanna Deimel, a German expert on the Balkans, pointed to published reports, based on a leaked U.S. intelligence document, that Serbia has quietly agreed to provide arms to Ukraine for its defense against the Russian invasion.

“On one hand, Belgrade has been criticized for refusing to join the EU sanctions against Russia, and on the other hand, it seems that, for example, arms deliveries to Ukraine are helping to turn a blind eye elsewhere,"" she said.

She also said efforts to align Serbia more closely with the West are complicated by Russian influence in the region’s media and its investments in the energy sector in the Balkans.

Kraemer noted that Serbia is almost entirely dependent on natural gas supplies from Russia and maintains trade and military ties with Moscow, while pro-Russian sentiments are high in the country.

The West ""has bent over backwards to try and lure Belgrade into the transatlantic fold with carrots while looking from the sidelines at Serbia’s proxy status vis-a-vis the Kremlin’s Balkan agenda,” he said.

“Why they thought this would work, considering Vucic’s overt refusal to get on board concerning Ukraine, remains a mystery to me.”

In the July letter, the U.S. and EU lawmakers criticized Vucic for close ties and support to Milorad Dodik, the nationalist president of the Republic of Srpska in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dodik has been sanctioned by the United States for “undermining the Dayton peace accords,” a U.S.-sponsored agreement that ended the Balkan war in the 1990s.

After a fatal firefight between masked gunmen and local police at a monastery in northern Kosovo, the territory's prime minister, Albin Kurti, accused Serbia of orchestrating the attack.

Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic denied state involvement and claimed the gunmen were Kosovo Serbs disillusioned with Mr Kurti's regime of ""terror"".

Now, members of the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment are being made available in the region.

Under the new arrangement, they will be placed under NATO's command ""if needed, to address the current situation"". They will form part of the KFOR peacekeeping force, which consists of around 4,500 troops from 27 NATO and partner countries.

Here Sky News looks at the origins of tensions between the two sides and how they've flared up this year.

Where does the conflict originate?

The conflict in the region goes back centuries.

Kosovo is largely made up of ethnic Albanians, who are mainly Muslim. It gained independence from Serbia, which is mostly Christian Orthodox, in 2008.

Although the US and most EU countries recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state, Serbia doesn't and believes it should still be part of its territory.

There are still several Serb Orthodox monasteries left in Kosovo - mainly in the north.

And Serbian nationalists still view their 1389 battle with Ottoman Turks there as symbolic of their struggle.

13,000 dead and a million displaced

In the years of the Soviet Union, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the former Yugoslavia, solidified by the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution.

But ethnic Albanians there wanted full republic status, with riots breaking out in 1981.

In the late 1980s, Slobodan Milosevic became the president of Serbia.

He began by exploiting tensions with the Serbian minority in Kosovo and by 1989 had abolished Kosovo's autonomous status, imposing direct rule from Belgrade.

In response, in the early 1990s, a peaceful Kosovan resistance movement emerged.

But when it failed to achieve its aims, in 1997 it was superseded by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which was prepared to use violence to gain independence.

Milosevic's brutal crackdown in 1998 resulted in around 13,000 deaths.

The Serbian leader, who was later charged with war crimes, failed to adhere to a NATO-drafted peace agreement in 1998, triggering a NATO military campaign to end the fighting.

This was championed by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is still seen as a ""saviour"" by many Kosovans.

After 78 days, mainly of heavy bombing, Milosevic gave in.

In June 1999, Serbia gave control of Kosovo to a temporary UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, which was supported by a NATO peacekeeping force (KFOR).

There were still reprisals by ethnic Albanians, with ethnic Serbs kidnapped or murdered and up to a million fleeing their homes.

After the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Russia helped draft a set of principles for Kosovo's future in the early 2000s, on 17 February 2008 it finally gained its independence.

NATO said 30 of its troops, 11 from Italy and 19 from Hungary, were injured in clashes.

According to commander Major General Angelo Michele Ristuccia, 52 Serbs were hurt, three seriously.

The clashes came after Serbia stepped up its military readiness by stationing itself on the Kosovo border late last year.

Ever since the violence of the 1990s, there have been international efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region.

Currently, they are trying to speed up negotiations and come to a fresh agreement.

NATO peacekeeping forces are trying to prevent Serbians from unleashing violence in Kosovo - as this would trigger a wider conflict with NATO allies.

In late May, NATO deployed an extra 700 troops to that end, which now include British ones.

Where does the conflict originate?

The conflict in the region goes back centuries.

Kosovo is largely made up of ethnic Albanians, who are mainly Muslim. It gained independence from Serbia, which is mostly Christian Orthodox, in 2008.

Although the US and most EU countries recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state, Serbia doesn't and believes it should still be part of its territory.

There are still several Serb Orthodox monasteries left in Kosovo - mainly in the north.

And Serbian nationalists still view their 1389 battle with Ottoman Turks there as symbolic of their struggle.

13,000 dead and a million displaced

In the years of the Soviet Union, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the former Yugoslavia, solidified by the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution.

But ethnic Albanians there wanted full republic status, with riots breaking out in 1981.

In the late 1980s, Slobodan Milosevic became the president of Serbia.

He began by exploiting tensions with the Serbian minority in Kosovo and by 1989 had abolished Kosovo's autonomous status, imposing direct rule from Belgrade.

In response, in the early 1990s, a peaceful Kosovan resistance movement emerged.

But when it failed to achieve its aims, in 1997 it was superseded by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which was prepared to use violence to gain independence.

Milosevic's brutal crackdown in 1998 resulted in around 13,000 deaths.

The Serbian leader, who was later charged with war crimes, failed to adhere to a NATO-drafted peace agreement in 1998, triggering a NATO military campaign to end the fighting.

This was championed by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is still seen as a ""saviour"" by many Kosovans.

After 78 days, mainly of heavy bombing, Milosevic gave in.

In June 1999, Serbia gave control of Kosovo to a temporary UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, which was supported by a NATO peacekeeping force (KFOR).

There were still reprisals by ethnic Albanians, with ethnic Serbs kidnapped or murdered and up to a million fleeing their homes.

After the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Russia helped draft a set of principles for Kosovo's future in the early 2000s, on 17 February 2008 it finally gained its independence.

In April, local elections were held in northern Kosovo.

The majority-Serb population boycotted the vote as they still want to be reunited with Belgrade.

This left only ethnic Albanians and other small minorities elected to mayoral and assembly posts.

When they came to take office, Serbs protested in front of municipal buildings to stop them from getting in.

They clashed with NATO peacekeepers and the local police, who used tear gas.

NATO said 30 of its troops, 11 from Italy and 19 from Hungary, were injured in clashes.

According to commander Major General Angelo Michele Ristuccia, 52 Serbs were hurt, three seriously.

The clashes came after Serbia stepped up its military readiness by stationing itself on the Kosovo border late last year.

What happens next?

Ever since the violence of the 1990s, there have been international efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region.

Currently, they are trying to speed up negotiations and come to a fresh agreement.

NATO peacekeeping forces are trying to prevent Serbians from unleashing violence in Kosovo - as this would trigger a wider conflict with NATO allies.

In late May, NATO deployed an extra 700 troops to that end, which now include British ones.

Let me begin by thanking Special Representative Ziadeh for her briefing and we welcome the participation to our meeting Her Excellency Ms. Vjosa Osmani, President of Kosovo, and Her Excellency Ms. Ana Brnabic, Prime Minister of Serbia.

The United Kingdom is a long-standing supporter of Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state. We welcome the Government’s continued progress on important issues such as the rule of law, transitional justice and tackling organised crime and corruption.

We fully support the Declaration on Missing Persons endorsed by both Kosovo and Serbia. This is a priority issue, and should not be politicised.

We also echo the Mission’s call for the Government of Kosovo to implement the 2016 ruling of the Constitutional Court of Kosovo regarding the Dečani monastery’s property. This would send a positive signal to minority communities and demonstrate Kosovo’s commitment to an inclusive, multi-ethnic future.

President, we also remain deeply concerned by the immediate security challenges in the north of Kosovo. We strongly condemn the attacks on international personnel in May and Kosovo Police on 24 September. It is vital that those responsible are brought to justice. We call on Serbia to cooperate fully with the investigations underway, and to take steps to address cross-border organised crime and arms smuggling.

Kosovo must be able to implement the rule of law across the whole of its territory, in close coordination with EULEX and KFOR. We are proud to have deployed approximately 600 UK soldiers to Kosovo in response to a request from NATO, to help fulfil KFOR’s mandate to maintain a safe and secure environment in Kosovo.

At this time of heightened tension, the normalisation of relations between Kosovo and Serbia remains vital. We urge both parties to engage with the EU-facilitated Dialogue to find mutually acceptable solutions, end the cycle of instability, and protect the hard-fought gains of the last decade.

We call on Kosovo and Serbia to honour their commitments and avoid unilateral actions or rhetoric that could reduce prospects for a comprehensive normalisation agreement. We urge both parties to engage constructively – including on the establishment of an Association of Serb Majority Municipalities - as soon as possible.

Finally, President, we recognise the vital role that UNMIK has played in the significant progress Kosovo has made since resolution 1244. But conditions on the ground are unrecognisable from 1999. We believe it is time to review UNMIK’s role and responsibilities. This would enable the Council to take a fresh look at how the Mission can adapt to serve the current conditions in Kosovo.

In closing, let me reiterate the UK’s gratitude to the Special Representative and the Mission for all of their work, and for the professional implementation of their mandate.","(1) [Kosovo]  
The United Kingdom firmly supports Kosovo as an independent state and commends its government for progress in areas such as the rule of law, transitional justice, and combating organized crime and corruption. The UK emphasizes the importance of the Declaration on Missing Persons and the implementation of the Constitutional Court's ruling regarding the Dečani monastery, which would enhance Kosovo's commitment to an inclusive society. #  

(2) [Serbia]  
The UK expresses concern over security challenges in northern Kosovo and condemns attacks on international personnel and local police. It urges Serbia to collaborate in ongoing investigations and address issues related to cross-border organized crime and arms smuggling.

(3) [Dialogue]  
The normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia is deemed crucial for regional stability. The UK calls on both parties to actively participate in the EU-facilitated Dialogue to seek mutually agreeable solutions and avoid actions that could hinder a comprehensive normalization agreement. Constructive engagement is essential, particularly regarding the establishment of an Association of Serb Majority Municipalities. #  

(4) [UNMIK]  
The UK acknowledges the significant contributions of UNMIK since resolution 1244 but suggests that it is time to reassess the Mission's role to better align with current conditions in Kosovo. A review could facilitate a more adaptive approach to support Kosovo’s ongoing progress and stability. #  

(5) [UK Military Presence]

The normalisation of relations between Kosovo and Serbia is vital: UK statement at the UN Security Council - GOV.UK,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxNdkhRaFB3LVdFTUE5YmtSUDdnc2hjWlJ4c2JIcEp5bzVjOG1SUk54LWJoZjNLR3ZuUkdYR0xBTjFGVTEwZ1NqTlhLb20wVjlnb0pFYnZMVGZGdlNDTVFjUGQ0YUJ1SmYyOURRbjlYb1JfRmUwWWZhdGxmZDgtODVLTFpRN3hOb2RtVjVaS3hvQVk5dXpCU200S3pNeWxNN2xjeTdMQkh4M0xYSjZFc0lVX3hLZ0NWOWVNc1lmQWNrXzBDZk5CbGN1NzBveGdZdlR2eUY4SDU0QThxdWtz?oc=5,GOV.UK,2023-10-23,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-normalisation-of-relations-between-kosovo-and-serbia-is-vital-uk-statement-at-the-un-security-council,"Thank you, President. Let me begin by thanking Special Representative Ziadeh for her briefing and we welcome the participation to our meeting Her Excellency Ms. Vjosa Osmani, President of Kosovo, and Her Excellency Ms. Ana Brnabic, Prime Minister of Serbia.

The United Kingdom is a long-standing supporter of Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state. We welcome the Government’s continued progress on important issues such as the rule of law, transitional justice and tackling organised crime and corruption.

We fully support the Declaration on Missing Persons endorsed by both Kosovo and Serbia. This is a priority issue, and should not be politicised.

We also echo the Mission’s call for the Government of Kosovo to implement the 2016 ruling of the Constitutional Court of Kosovo regarding the Dečani monastery’s property. This would send a positive signal to minority communities and demonstrate Kosovo’s commitment to an inclusive, multi-ethnic future.

President, we also remain deeply concerned by the immediate security challenges in the north of Kosovo. We strongly condemn the attacks on international personnel in May and Kosovo Police on 24 September. It is vital that those responsible are brought to justice. We call on Serbia to cooperate fully with the investigations underway, and to take steps to address cross-border organised crime and arms smuggling.

Kosovo must be able to implement the rule of law across the whole of its territory, in close coordination with EULEX and KFOR. We are proud to have deployed approximately 600 UK soldiers to Kosovo in response to a request from NATO, to help fulfil KFOR’s mandate to maintain a safe and secure environment in Kosovo.

At this time of heightened tension, the normalisation of relations between Kosovo and Serbia remains vital. We urge both parties to engage with the EU-facilitated Dialogue to find mutually acceptable solutions, end the cycle of instability, and protect the hard-fought gains of the last decade.

We call on Kosovo and Serbia to honour their commitments and avoid unilateral actions or rhetoric that could reduce prospects for a comprehensive normalisation agreement. We urge both parties to engage constructively – including on the establishment of an Association of Serb Majority Municipalities - as soon as possible.

Finally, President, we recognise the vital role that UNMIK has played in the significant progress Kosovo has made since resolution 1244. But conditions on the ground are unrecognisable from 1999. We believe it is time to review UNMIK’s role and responsibilities. This would enable the Council to take a fresh look at how the Mission can adapt to serve the current conditions in Kosovo.

In closing, let me reiterate the UK’s gratitude to the Special Representative and the Mission for all of their work, and for the professional implementation of their mandate.","(1) [Kosovo]

The Serbian Roots of Kosovo Turmoil - Australian Institute of International Affairs,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPTkl3bU1VR3pfZWxHcUZJU1M2ZW5vRFRjb2ZYYlNyN2NyUHRJSXh1NURMRjliZ2NTclNfbjc4ZnFQcTR5cDlHM2N0NDlGMGJUN3lCeDhfTF84UDdvX1BiTjJVWHB6TXNpUEh0TGtvVjE2dTJtd3dIM1VRRUNIaE1uV0YySnBhUHVqeXVscjhCSGk4V1FEMmh2dFZ3?oc=5,Australian Institute of International Affairs,2023-10-31,https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/the-serbian-roots-of-kosovo-turmoil/,"Serbia is undermining European security and re-hashing the painful history of the 1990’s. The world should be alarmed.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, western policymakers urgently shifted their Balkans foreign policy strategy to bring Serbia into the fold. It hasn’t entirely been effective, as Serbia continues to ferment instability in an already fraught region, largely through its coercive and bullying tactics of a neighbour it does not recognise: which is Kosovo.

The recent events in Kosovo have highlighted a significant escalation of violence and have worsened already deteriorating relations between Belgrade and Pristina. According to renowned Balkans political analyst Jasmin Mujanovic, “Serbia is making a sharp u-turn back toward 1991 before our eyes.” Additionally, a policy of appeasement from the European Union (EU) and the United States is emboldening Belgrade. An urgent policy reset is needed.

On the 24 September 2023, around 30 gunmen were involved in an hours-long shootout with Kosovo authorities, killing a police officer in the town of Banjska in the country’s north. Other events in May, where 30 international peacekeepers were injured in riots by Serbian Nationalists, illustrate the emerging challenges for regional peace and stability. Later, Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti alleged that the weapons, equipment, and vehicles utilised in the attack were too sophisticated, and that they enjoyed the full support of the Serbian state. Kurti also alleged that Milan Radoicic, a top Kosovo Serb politician, admitted that he planned and “received logistical, military equipment and preparation from Belgrade, and also received political orders from President Vucic.” The Director General of the Kosovo Police, Gazmend Hoxha, has alleged that the primary objective of the paramilitary force was to “annex the entire north of Kosovo.”

This has all been met with fierce denials from Serbian President Aleksander Vucic, who has stated that Serbia will investigate. Milan Radoicic ended up spending a mere 48 hours in custody and will not face justice in a Kosovo court. Belgrade clearly fears no genuine reprisals from the west. It is also crucial to note that Alexsander Vucic was the former Minister for Propaganda under Slobodan Milosevic.

Mere days after the death of the Kosovo policeman, and after the United States National Security Council accused Serbia of a major military build up along the border, United States ambassador to Serbia Christopher Hill suggested that Belgrade pursue NATO membership. This inconsistent and incoherent messaging is detrimental to Balkan Security and harms stability within the region.

Double standards for Kosovo are equally troubling. When Serbian nationalists boycotted mayoral elections in May of this year, US ambassador to Kosovo Jeff Hovenier and Senator Chris Murphy condemned Kosovo’s decision to access municipal buildings in the north of the country, despite Kosovo having the total legal justification and jurisdiction to do so. Additionally, Kosovo is under a punitive sanctions regime from the EU for failing to “de-escalate” tensions with its neighbour.

The policy plan proposed by Brussels is fundamentally misguided, and unfairly one-sided, and includes the withdrawal of special units from the Kosovo police in the north, the relocation of the mayors from the municipal buildings, and announcements of early elections. While Kosovo agrees with elections being rescheduled, Pristina’s other demands have been largely ignored by Serbia. Most troubling is that the future of Kosovo’s EU accession entirely runs through dialogue with Serbia, despite Vucic not wanting membership. This has caused a fundamental asymmetry in negotiations and plays into the hands of Belgrade.

Right now, murals are appearing over Serbia that say, “When the army returns to Kosovo.” Banners are being unfurled of the terrorists that were killed at Banksja in Kosovo at UEFA Champions League Matches while fans chant “ubij, zakolji, da šiptar ne postoji” – “kill and slaughter so that the Shiptar doesn’t exist.” To clarify, Shiptar is a derogatory term used against Albanians.

Renowned CNN international correspondent Christiane Amanpour pressed Vucic on his undermining of negotiations such as the Ohrid Agreement. Famously, Vucic and Kurti agreed upon terms in 2021, but only verbally. Immediately after, Vucic walked away from the agreement, and, refusing to sign it physically, he said “I have excruciating pain in my right hand. I can only sign with my right hand. And that pain is expected to continue for the next four years,” thereby making a mockery of mediation efforts. The agreement does not explicitly require that Serbia recognises the independence of Kosovo, but it does prevent Serbia from opposing the accession of Kosovo to international organisations like the Council of Europe, the EU or NATO. It does require Serbia to recognise Kosovar national symbols, diplomas, and vehicle registration pla","(1) [Serbia]  
Serbia's actions are increasingly destabilizing the Balkans, reflecting a return to the tensions of the 1990s. The ongoing aggressive stance towards Kosovo, coupled with a lack of accountability for violent incidents involving Serbian nationalists, raises concerns about regional security. This situation is exacerbated by the perceived lack of repercussions from Western powers, which emboldens Serbia's government under President Aleksandar Vucic. #  

(2) [Kosovo]  
Recent violence in Kosovo, including the death of a police officer and attacks on peacekeepers, underscores the fragility of peace in the region. Kosovo's leadership claims that these incidents are supported by the Serbian state, highlighting the serious risks associated with Serbia's military buildup along the border. The ongoing tensions and inflammatory rhetoric from both sides threaten to escalate further if not addressed appropriately. #  

(3) [International Relations]  
The response from Western powers, particularly the EU and the US, has been criticized as inconsistent and one-sided, contributing to an imbalance in negotiations with Kosovo. Calls for Serbia to join NATO juxtaposed with punitive measures against Kosovo create confusion and hinder effective diplomatic solutions. The current policy framework appears to favor Serbia's position over Kosovo's, complicating the path to peace and stability in the region. #  

(4) [Mediation Efforts]  
Efforts to mediate between Serbia and Kosovo, such as the Ohrid Agreement, have been undermined by Serbia's non-compliance and mockery of the process. Vucic's refusal to formally sign agreements and his evasive tactics demonstrate a lack of genuine commitment to peace. This undermines trust in diplomatic negotiations and poses significant challenges to achieving a lasting resolution to the conflict. #  

(5) [Regional Sentiment]  
Rising nationalism and provocative sentiments within Serbia, as reflected in public displays and rhetoric, suggest a growing acceptance of extremist views against Kosovo. This cultural shift towards aggression could further escalate tensions, making reconciliation efforts more difficult. The use of derogatory language and glorification of violence underscores the urgent need for effective intervention and dialogue to foster peace in the region. #",Serbia,"Serbia's actions are increasingly destabilizing the Balkans, reflecting a return to the tensions of the 1990s.

Additionally, Kosovo is under a punitive sanctions regime from the EU for failing to “de-escalate” tensions with its neighbour.

The policy plan proposed by Brussels is fundamentally misguided, and unfairly one-sided, and includes the withdrawal of special units from the Kosovo police in the north, the relocation of the mayors from the municipal buildings, and announcements of early elections. While Kosovo agrees with elections being rescheduled, Pristina’s other demands have been largely ignored by Serbia. Most troubling is that the future of Kosovo’s EU accession entirely runs through dialogue with Serbia, despite Vucic not wanting membership. This has caused a fundamental asymmetry in negotiations and plays into the hands of Belgrade.

Right now, murals are appearing over Serbia that say, “When the army returns to Kosovo.” Banners are being unfurled of the terrorists that were killed at Banksja in Kosovo at UEFA Champions League Matches while fans chant “ubij, zakolji, da šiptar ne postoji” – “kill and slaughter so that the Shiptar doesn’t exist.” To clarify, Shiptar is a derogatory term used against Albanians.

Renowned CNN international correspondent Christiane Amanpour pressed Vucic on his undermining of negotiations such as the Ohrid Agreement. Famously, Vucic and Kurti agreed upon terms in 2021, but only verbally. Immediately after, Vucic walked away from the agreement, and, refusing to sign it physically, he said “I have excruciating pain in my right hand. I can only sign with my right hand. And that pain is expected to continue for the next four years,” thereby making a mockery of mediation efforts. The agreement does not explicitly require that Serbia recognises the independence of Kosovo, but it does prevent Serbia from opposing the accession of Kosovo to international organisations like the Council of Europe, the EU or NATO.

Serbia's actions are increasingly destabilizing the Balkans, reflecting a return to the tensions of the 1990s. The ongoing aggressive stance towards Kosovo, coupled with a lack of accountability for violent incidents involving Serbian nationalists, raises concerns about regional security. This situation is exacerbated by the perceived lack of repercussions from Western powers, which emboldens Serbia's government under President Aleksandar Vucic. #

Recent violence in Kosovo, including the death of a police officer and attacks on peacekeepers, underscores the fragility of peace in the region. Kosovo's leadership claims that these incidents are supported by the Serbian state, highlighting the serious risks associated with Serbia's military buildup along the border. The ongoing tensions and inflammatory rhetoric from both sides threaten to escalate further if not addressed appropriately. #

The response from Western powers, particularly the EU and the US, has been criticized as inconsistent and one-sided, contributing to an imbalance in negotiations with Kosovo.

The Serbian Roots of Kosovo Turmoil - Australian Institute of International Affairs,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPTkl3bU1VR3pfZWxHcUZJU1M2ZW5vRFRjb2ZYYlNyN2NyUHRJSXh1NURMRjliZ2NTclNfbjc4ZnFQcTR5cDlHM2N0NDlGMGJUN3lCeDhfTF84UDdvX1BiTjJVWHB6TXNpUEh0TGtvVjE2dTJtd3dIM1VRRUNIaE1uV0YySnBhUHVqeXVscjhCSGk4V1FEMmh2dFZ3?oc=5,Australian Institute of International Affairs,2023-10-31,https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/the-serbian-roots-of-kosovo-turmoil/,"Serbia is undermining European security and re-hashing the painful history of the 1990’s. The world should be alarmed.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, western policymakers urgently shifted their Balkans foreign policy strategy to bring Serbia into the fold. It hasn’t entirely been effective, as Serbia continues to ferment instability in an already fraught region, largely through its coercive and bullying tactics of a neighbour it does not recognise: which is Kosovo.

The recent events in Kosovo have highlighted a significant escalation of violence and have worsened already deteriorating relations between Belgrade and Pristina. According to renowned Balkans political analyst Jasmin Mujanovic, “Serbia is making a sharp u-turn back toward 1991 before our eyes.” Additionally, a policy of appeasement from the European Union (EU) and the United States is emboldening Belgrade. An urgent policy reset is needed.

On the 24 September 2023, around 30 gunmen were involved in an hours-long shootout with Kosovo authorities, killing a police officer in the town of Banjska in the country’s north. Other events in May, where 30 international peacekeepers were injured in riots by Serbian Nationalists, illustrate the emerging challenges for regional peace and stability. Later, Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti alleged that the weapons, equipment, and vehicles utilised in the attack were too sophisticated, and that they enjoyed the full support of the Serbian state. Kurti also alleged that Milan Radoicic, a top Kosovo Serb politician, admitted that he planned and “received logistical, military equipment and preparation from Belgrade, and also received political orders from President Vucic.” The Director General of the Kosovo Police, Gazmend Hoxha, has alleged that the primary objective of the paramilitary force was to “annex the entire north of Kosovo.”

This has all been met with fierce denials from Serbian President Aleksander Vucic, who has stated that Serbia will investigate. Milan Radoicic ended up spending a mere 48 hours in custody and will not face justice in a Kosovo court. Belgrade clearly fears no genuine reprisals from the west. It is also crucial to note that Alexsander Vucic was the former Minister for Propaganda under Slobodan Milosevic.

Mere days after the death of the Kosovo policeman, and after the United States National Security Council accused Serbia of a major military build up along the border, United States ambassador to Serbia Christopher Hill suggested that Belgrade pursue NATO membership. This inconsistent and incoherent messaging is detrimental to Balkan Security and harms stability within the region.

Double standards for Kosovo are equally troubling. When Serbian nationalists boycotted mayoral elections in May of this year, US ambassador to Kosovo Jeff Hovenier and Senator Chris Murphy condemned Kosovo’s decision to access municipal buildings in the north of the country, despite Kosovo having the total legal justification and jurisdiction to do so.

On 4 December 2023, H.E. Ms. Vimolbajra Ruksakiati, Ambassador of Thailand to Norway, hosted a Reception on the occasion of the Birthday Anniversary of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, Thai National Day, and Thai Father’s Day at the Thai Residence. The Reception was attended by 85 distinguished participants including H.E. Mr. Erling Rimestad, former State Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, H.E. Mrs. Tone Elisabeth Bækkevold Allers, Chief of Protocol and Director General, Department for Cultural Relations and Protocol, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tage Pettersen, Storting Representative for Østfold, as well as members of Diplomatic corps in Norway, including Ambassadors of Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, South Korea, India, Morocco, Cuba, El Salvador, Chile, Canada, Serbia, United Kingdom, Kosovo, Italy, and the EU and representatives from business sector, including Mr. Bjørn Tore Larsen, CEO of Norse Atlantic Airways, Mr. Terje Ommundsen, owner of Plah and Ahaan restaurants, a representative from OKEA ASA and representatives from Thai community in Norway including the Thai Women’s Association in Norway, Thai-Norway Language and Cultural Association, Thailand NIE Learning Centre in Østfold, Thai Music and Dance Club in Norway, Thai Buddhist Association in Norway, Wat Thai Norway, and Thai Language and Cultural Association in Grenland.

Ambassador Vimolbajra paid respect in front of the royal portraits of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great and of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phravajiraklaochaoyuhua and invited the attendances to pay respect to the Royal Anthem of Thailand and the Norwegian National Anthem.

On this occasion, Ambassador Vimolbajra delivered her remarks, honoring in praise and remembrance of the continuous hard work of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, which His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phravajiraklaochaoyuhua has carried on the development projects of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, especially the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, and initiated the 904 Royal Volunteers Training Center as a learning hub for His Father’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and the volunteer activities for the stronger Thai society.

Ambassador Vimolbajra said that Thailand and Norway share constructive and meaningful friendship. The starting point of our relations dated back to the 1907 historic visit by His Majesty King Chulalongkorn, which developed into close and cordial tie, especially between our peoples. This year, the bilateral relations have been even more dynamic, especially with the 12th Bilateral Consultations between Thailand and Norway held at the political level, the oldest bilateral mechanism that Thailand has with the Northern European countries. Both sides agreed on cooperation in many issues, notably clean and renewable energy. Furthermore, the inaugural flight between Oslo and Bangkok, operated by the Norse Atlantic Airways, last month also promote people-to-people connectivity and tourism. The trade volumes between Thailand and Norway have grown significantly, and the Thai-EFTA FTA negotiation, which is targeted to be completed next year, is in full steam. Thailand hopes to see more Norwegian investment in Thailand, especially the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, to join in many mega projects in Thailand, including Landbridge.

For the past four years, Ambassador Vimolbajra said that she traveled extensively to over 27 major cities in Norway from Svalbard, North Cape, Kirkenes to Kristiansand, which have enriched her learning experiences about Norway, and paid study visits with the Thailand and Nordic Countries Innovation Unit (TNIU) to learn about Norway’s expertise, including marine debris management, sustainable aquaculture, and oil production platform, which the cooperation between Thailand’s Bangchak group and Norwegian OKEA ASA is a good model of cooperation in the field of energy sustainability.

Ambassador Vimolbajra expressed her deepest appreciation to the Thai community in Norway of over 30,000 people for giving her heart-warming support from day one and that they have inspired her to perform her duty to the best of her ability. She said she is very proud of them as they are a strong community and represent Thailand-Norwegian relations in the most genuine and meaningful way.

On 4 December 2023, H.E. Ms. Vimolbajra Ruksakiati, Ambassador of Thailand to Norway, hosted a Reception on the occasion of the Birthday Anniversary of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, Thai National Day, and Thai Father’s Day at the Thai Residence. The Reception was attended by 85 distinguished participants including H.E. Mr. Erling Rimestad, former State Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, H.E. Mrs. Tone Elisabeth Bækkevold Allers, Chief of Protocol and Director General, Department for Cultural Relations and Protocol, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tage Pettersen, Storting Representative for Østfold, as well as members of Diplomatic corps in Norway, including Ambassadors of Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, South Korea, India, Morocco, Cuba, El Salvador, Chile, Canada, Serbia, United Kingdom, Kosovo, Italy, and the EU and representatives from business sector, including Mr. Bjørn Tore Larsen, CEO of Norse Atlantic Airways, Mr. Terje Ommundsen, owner of Plah and Ahaan restaurants, a representative from OKEA ASA and representatives from Thai community in Norway including the Thai Women’s Association in Norway, Thai-Norway Language and Cultural Association, Thailand NIE Learning Centre in Østfold, Thai Music and Dance Club in Norway, Thai Buddhist Association in Norway, Wat Thai Norway, and Thai Language and Cultural Association in Grenland.

Ambassador Vimolbajra paid respect in front of the royal portraits of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great and of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phravajiraklaochaoyuhua and invited the attendances to pay respect to the Royal Anthem of Thailand and the Norwegian National Anthem.

On this occasion, Ambassador Vimolbajra delivered her remarks, honoring in praise and remembrance of the continuous hard work of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, which His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phravajiraklaochaoyuhua has carried on the development projects of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, especially the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, and initiated the 904 Royal Volunteers Training Center as a learning hub for His Father’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and the volunteer activities for the stronger Thai society.

Ambassador Vimolbajra said that Thailand and Norway share constructive and meaningful friendship. The starting point of our relations dated back to the 1907 historic visit by His Majesty King Chulalongkorn, which developed into close and cordial tie, especially between our peoples. This year, the bilateral relations have been even more dynamic, especially with the 12th Bilateral Consultations between Thailand and Norway held at the political level, the oldest bilateral mechanism that Thailand has with the Northern European countries. Both sides agreed on cooperation in many issues, notably clean and renewable energy. Furthermore, the inaugural flight between Oslo and Bangkok, operated by the Norse Atlantic Airways, last month also promote people-to-people connectivity and tourism. The trade volumes between Thailand and Norway have grown significantly, and the Thai-EFTA FTA negotiation, which is targeted to be completed next year, is in full steam. Thailand hopes to see more Norwegian investment in Thailand, especially the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, to join in many mega projects in Thailand, including Landbridge.

For the past four years, Ambassador Vimolbajra said that she traveled extensively to over 27 major cities in Norway from Svalbard, North Cape, Kirkenes to Kristiansand, which have enriched her learning experiences about Norway, and paid study visits with the Thailand and Nordic Countries Innovation Unit (TNIU) to learn about Norway’s expertise, including marine debris management, sustainable aquaculture, and oil production platform, which the cooperation between Thailand’s Bangchak group and Norwegian OKEA ASA is a good model of cooperation in the field of energy sustainability.

Ambassador Vimolbajra expressed her deepest appreciation to the Thai community in Norway of over 30,000 people for giving her heart-warming support from day one and that they have inspired her to perform her duty to the best of her ability. She said she is very proud of them as they are a strong community and represent Thailand-Norwegian relations in the most genuine and meaningful way.

The Implications of China-Serbia Relations for Kosovo - The Diplomat,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPWTkxRXlLcnh4by0xUk5DN0JsVGdJRmdCbFFIQUI4eWpUTG16M2RCUW5ueHZwR0R2Rk9JZkVDUUNZUW1xazhlUzJiM0VZWGJ2OTBycjJXYXV1Z21oOEx3d3lXaEpnaUpGRnJQbWp2RVpCMHhzSTJZZnlxeDJlZTV5dm45cGkxRnhjcUxjV3ZvUQ?oc=5,The Diplomat,2023-12-28,https://thediplomat.com/2023/12/the-implications-of-china-serbia-relations-for-kosovo/,"Pristina is clearly with the U.S. and EU, while Serbia has partnered with China and Russia to dispute the goal of fully recognized independence.

When Kosovo declared independence in 2008, it marked the beginning of diplomatic efforts by Serbia to dispute Kosovo’s statehood, leading Belgrade to establish unexpected partnerships with countries around the globe.

Out of those efforts, and with the new agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to extend its global outreach, came the partnership between Serbia and China. Today, 15 years after the separation from Serbia, Kosovo finds that its independence is still an object of interest – not only to the parties directly involved but also to great powers trying to fortify their positions on the question of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The official position of Belgrade regarding Kosovo’s status, defined by United Nations Resolution 1244, is that Kosovo is not an independent country. The institutionalized process of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is led under the framework of the European Union and supported by the United States. However, Serbia has turned to partners in Moscow and Beijing to ensure that, if nothing else, Kosovo will not become a member of the United Nations, and that those partners will be ready to use their U.N. Security Council veto right to prevent that from happening.

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, having Russia as a partner has become more of a liability. Serbia, a country with EU membership candidate status, has not followed European countries and transatlantic partners in formally distancing itself from Russia. But, at least unofficially, Belgrade has turned to other partners in order to foster strategic interests, including the dispute over Kosovo’s independence.

Under these circumstances, the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty have started playing a more significant role in the communications coming out of the meetings between Serbian and Chinese officials.

During the Third Belt and Road Forum in October 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, after a meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, that Serbia was “an ironclad friend” of China. Xi also noted that “China firmly supports Serbia in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” and stands ready to strengthen strategic synergy with Serbia and to translate “the traditional friendship between the two countries into more practical cooperation results.”

For Kosovo, the strength of the China-Serbia relationship is yet another obstacle to achieving full international recognition. The partnership between Serbia and China might not be at the top of the list of issues burdening the Kosovars, but it could have great relevance, especially for the aspirations of Kosovo to join the United Nations one day.

According to a former minister of foreign affairs of Kosovo, “the only way for Kosovo to impose itself successfully in Brussels or Berlin is as a solution, not as a problem.” Recently, however, the government in Pristina has increasingly been seen as a challenging partner by officials in Brussels and Washington.

A preference for Euro-Atlantic integration has played a significant role in the politics of Pristina. Pristina is clearly with the West, and the fact that Serbia has partnered with the East to dispute the goal of fully recognized independence has not lessened Kosovo’s dedication to European integration.

However, in recent years, Kosovo’s Euro-Atlantic consensus has faced challenges due to the rise of populism. A former senior government official from Kosovo said, “Everyone likes the idea of membership in the EU, but no one cares about the obligations that come with the process. For example, Kosovo lost four years in the border demarcation with Montenegro.” On several occasions, representatives from both the U.S. government and the EU have publicly criticized the Kosovo government’s positions, citing a lack of coordination with the United States and European Union.

The stagnation of the process for normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, facilitated by the EU and supported by the U.S., has compounded challenges in the Western Balkans. According to Agon Maliqi, EU policy toward the region, often described as being on autopilot and characterized as “containment” for the past decade, has intensified these challenges.

Maliqi argued that the absence of a clear EU perspective has played a significant role in the escalation of ethnic border issues and heightened security concerns, particularly for NATO. From Kosovo’s perspective, an ineffective EU is welcomed by China, because this situation presents an opportunity for China to position itself as a more “capable and reliable” partner. Notably, in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a discernible positive shift in the EU’s approach to the Western Balkans, particularly with regard to the enlargement perspect","(1) [Serbia]  
Serbia has established strategic partnerships with China and Russia to oppose Kosovo's independence, despite its candidate status for EU membership. This alignment with non-Western powers aims to secure Serbia's interests in the ongoing dispute over Kosovo's statehood, particularly within the United Nations framework. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has complicated Serbia's relationship with Russia, leading it to seek alternative partnerships while still maintaining ties with Moscow. #  

(2) [Kosovo]  
Kosovo's pursuit of international recognition and integration into Euro-Atlantic structures faces significant hurdles, primarily due to Serbia's alliances with China and Russia. The Kosovo government, while aligned with Western interests, has struggled with internal challenges and a perception of being a problematic partner in negotiations with the EU and the U.S. This dynamic complicates Kosovo's aspirations for full statehood recognition, especially with the backing Serbia receives from its eastern partners. #  

(3) [International Relations]  
The geopolitical landscape in the Western Balkans is shifting, with Serbia’s partnership with China reinforcing its stance against Kosovo's independence. The recent diplomatic engagements, including statements from Chinese President Xi Jinping, illustrate the growing influence of China in the region and its implications for Kosovo's quest for UN membership. This evolving dynamic, coupled with the EU's inconsistent approach to the region, presents both opportunities and challenges for all parties involved. #  

(4) [EU Dynamics]  
The EU's policy towards the Western Balkans has been criticized for its stagnation and lack of clear direction, impacting the normalization process between Kosovo and Serbia. The absence of a robust EU perspective has exacerbated ethnic tensions and security concerns, fostering an environment where external powers, such as China, can increase their influence. Recent shifts in the EU’s approach following the Ukraine crisis may offer a new avenue for engagement, but challenges remain significant. #  

(5) [Populism]  
The rise of populism in Kosovo has complicated its Euro-Atlantic integration efforts, as public sentiment often favors EU membership without a commitment to necessary obligations. This disconnect has led to criticism from U.S. and EU officials, highlighting a need for better cooperation and understanding of the integration process. As such, Kosovo's leadership faces the dual challenge of aligning domestic priorities with international expectations while navigating a complex regional landscape. #",Serbia,"Serbia has established strategic partnerships with China and Russia to oppose Kosovo's independence, despite its candidate status for EU membership.

According to a former minister of foreign affairs of Kosovo, “the only way for Kosovo to impose itself successfully in Brussels or Berlin is as a solution, not as a problem.” Recently, however, the government in Pristina has increasingly been seen as a challenging partner by officials in Brussels and Washington.

A preference for Euro-Atlantic integration has played a significant role in the politics of Pristina. Pristina is clearly with the West, and the fact that Serbia has partnered with the East to dispute the goal of fully recognized independence has not lessened Kosovo’s dedication to European integration.

However, in recent years, Kosovo’s Euro-Atlantic consensus has faced challenges due to the rise of populism. A former senior government official from Kosovo said, “Everyone likes the idea of membership in the EU, but no one cares about the obligations that come with the process. For example, Kosovo lost four years in the border demarcation with Montenegro.” On several occasions, representatives from both the U.S. government and the EU have publicly criticized the Kosovo government’s positions, citing a lack of coordination with the United States and European Union.

The stagnation of the process for normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, facilitated by the EU and supported by the U.S., has compounded challenges in the Western Balkans. According to Agon Maliqi, EU policy toward the region, often described as being on autopilot and characterized as “containment” for the past decade, has intensified these challenges.

Maliqi argued that the absence of a clear EU perspective has played a significant role in the escalation of ethnic border issues and heightened security concerns, particularly for NATO. From Kosovo’s perspective, an ineffective EU is welcomed by China, because this situation presents an opportunity for China to position itself as a more “capable and reliable” partner. Notably, in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a discernible positive shift in the EU’s approach to the Western Balkans, particularly with regard to the enlargement perspect","(1) [Serbia]  
Serbia has established strategic partnerships with China and Russia to oppose Kosovo's independence, despite its candidate status for EU membership. This alignment with non-Western powers aims to secure Serbia's interests in the ongoing dispute over Kosovo's statehood, particularly within the United Nations framework. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has complicated Serbia's relationship with Russia, leading it to seek alternative partnerships while still maintaining ties with Moscow. #

Kosovo's pursuit of international recognition and integration into Euro-Atlantic structures faces significant hurdles, primarily due to Serbia's alliances with China and Russia. The Kosovo government, while aligned with Western interests, has struggled with internal challenges and a perception of being a problematic partner in negotiations with the EU and the U.S. This dynamic complicates Kosovo's aspirations for full statehood recognition, especially with the backing Serbia receives from its eastern partners. #

The geopolitical landscape in the Western Balkans is shifting, with Serbia’s partnership with China reinforcing its stance against Kosovo's independence. The recent diplomatic engagements, including statements from Chinese President Xi Jinping, illustrate the growing influence of China in the region and its implications for Kosovo's quest for UN membership. This evolving dynamic, coupled with the EU's inconsistent approach to the region, presents both opportunities and challenges for all parties involved. #

The EU's policy towards the Western Balkans has been criticized for its stagnation and lack of clear direction, impacting the normalization process between Kosovo and Serbia. The absence of a robust EU perspective has exacerbated ethnic tensions and security concerns, fostering an environment where external powers, such as China, can increase their influence. Recent shifts in the EU’s approach following the Ukraine crisis may offer a new avenue for engagement, but challenges remain significant. #

The rise of populism in Kosovo has complicated its Euro-Atlantic integration efforts, as public sentiment often favors EU membership without a commitment to necessary obligations.

The Implications of China-Serbia Relations for Kosovo - The Diplomat,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPWTkxRXlLcnh4by0xUk5DN0JsVGdJRmdCbFFIQUI4eWpUTG16M2RCUW5ueHZwR0R2Rk9JZkVDUUNZUW1xazhlUzJiM0VZWGJ2OTBycjJXYXV1Z21oOEx3d3lXaEpnaUpGRnJQbWp2RVpCMHhzSTJZZnlxeDJlZTV5dm45cGkxRnhjcUxjV3ZvUQ?oc=5,The Diplomat,2023-12-28,https://thediplomat.com/2023/12/the-implications-of-china-serbia-relations-for-kosovo/,"Pristina is clearly with the U.S. and EU, while Serbia has partnered with China and Russia to dispute the goal of fully recognized independence.

When Kosovo declared independence in 2008, it marked the beginning of diplomatic efforts by Serbia to dispute Kosovo’s statehood, leading Belgrade to establish unexpected partnerships with countries around the globe.

Out of those efforts, and with the new agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to extend its global outreach, came the partnership between Serbia and China. Today, 15 years after the separation from Serbia, Kosovo finds that its independence is still an object of interest – not only to the parties directly involved but also to great powers trying to fortify their positions on the question of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The official position of Belgrade regarding Kosovo’s status, defined by United Nations Resolution 1244, is that Kosovo is not an independent country. The institutionalized process of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is led under the framework of the European Union and supported by the United States. However, Serbia has turned to partners in Moscow and Beijing to ensure that, if nothing else, Kosovo will not become a member of the United Nations, and that those partners will be ready to use their U.N. Security Council veto right to prevent that from happening.

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, having Russia as a partner has become more of a liability. Serbia, a country with EU membership candidate status, has not followed European countries and transatlantic partners in formally distancing itself from Russia. But, at least unofficially, Belgrade has turned to other partners in order to foster strategic interests, including the dispute over Kosovo’s independence.

Under these circumstances, the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty have started playing a more significant role in the communications coming out of the meetings between Serbian and Chinese officials.

During the Third Belt and Road Forum in October 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, after a meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, that Serbia was “an ironclad friend” of China. Xi also noted that “China firmly supports Serbia in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” and stands ready to strengthen strategic synergy with Serbia and to translate “the traditional friendship between the two countries into more practical cooperation results.”

For Kosovo, the strength of the China-Serbia relationship is yet another obstacle to achieving full international recognition. The partnership between Serbia and China might not be at the top of the list of issues burdening the Kosovars, but it could have great relevance, especially for the aspirations of Kosovo to join the United Nations one day.

Russia: Serbia’s history is key to understanding its close relationship with Moscow - theconversation.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQalVIRGxjb1hSbTl0djMyVzd2c09UVzRFUkk0Nm8xajMzY1hpb05sUHBWaEZhNUE3c3dQME16SE56c1VSYVJET3hJQ005WDl3Vnc4QW85QnhlUU5lR2hYNDd0NjM5Y0Z5SUd0UnRPS2d2ZFUtNDdna3ZfdkFMR1pxOTRYOGdRckV1WkhxWHNIQms4ZUdnSlVfT2VZU2VQZWVCdTRJdVFqNi1LX3lrUkNLVUxZMGdERkE?oc=5,theconversation.com,2024-02-27,https://theconversation.com/russia-serbias-history-is-key-to-understanding-its-close-relationship-with-moscow-223601,"Over the past few weeks, international attention has focused on Ukraine in the run-up to the second anniversary of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. But Ukraine is not the only part of Europe where Russia is seeking to assert its influence and control.

Often overlooked by the international community in a world beset by international crises, Serbia, another aspiring member of the European Union, finds itself at a crossroads between pursuing its future within the bloc or staying within Moscow’s orbit.

Despite the promise of greater prosperity within the EU, many fear that Serbia is moving closer to the Kremlin again. Indeed, Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić announced in February that he had purchased an anti-drone system, combat vehicles and infantry equipment from Russia.

The country has been historically close to Russia. In modern times, this relationship was cemented by Russia backing Serbia’s opposition to Kosovan independence. The Kremlin was against the province becoming an independent nation and suggested this would be a breach of international law.

Russia remains popular among many Serbs, and the country has refused to follow the rest of Europe in imposing sanctions on its old ally over the Ukraine invasion.

Many non-Serbs in the western Balkans distrust Russia, particularly because of its long-term support for Serbia – and those fears were exacerbated by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Indeed, before the invasion Russia showed whose side it was on in the Balkans when Moscow wielded its UN Security Council veto in 2015 to prevent a resolution that would have recognised the Srebrenica massacres as genocide on the 20th anniversary of those atrocities during the Balkan war. Around 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered in Srebrenica.

The narrative of genocide denial in the Russian media was even used to counter accusations of atrocities by Russian forces in Ukraine, notably Bucha. A report on Russian state-controlled First TV said:

Recall that [Srebrenica] has become synonymous with the genocide of the Muslim population, which, according to the west, was committed by the Bosnian Serbs in July 1995. But over time, many facts appeared confirming that a well-planned operation was carried out in Srebrenica, behind which stood western intelligence services.

Russia has long had a role in the western Balkans and sees its partnership with Serbia as a means of countering western influence in the region. This means Russia pulling Serbia away from forging closer ties with the EU and as former US ambassador to Nato, Kurt Volker, said at the time: “Moscow wants to make it clear that the Balkans won’t be part of mainstream Europe.”

Recent elections in Serbia, condemned by EU observers as being “below the expected standards for an EU candidate country”, added to concerns especially when demonstrators were condemned as “thugs” by Vučić , who thanked the Russians for tipping him off in advance that the protests were taking place.

Serbia also refuses to align with the rest of Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia with Vučić recently telling Tass, Russia’s state-run news agency: “You have many friends in Europe, but they all imposed sanctions against you. The only country that did not introduce sanctions is little Serbia.”

Vučić has also signed cooperation agreements with Moscow. Russia’s soft power remains strong in the country where the population regards Russia as its “greatest friend” and one survey found 63% blame the west for Russia’s war in Ukraine.

EU and the Balkans

The EU is at its heart a peace process, first formed from the carnage of the second world war. That peace was shattered by the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the genocide that took place during the conflict, notably during the war in Bosnia. That failure still haunts EU decision makers.

In June 2003 at the EU Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki in Greece, European leaders decided to identify the countries of the region, as potential candidates for membership, including Serbia.

In September 2013 a stabilisation and association agreement between Serbia and the EU came into force. A conference in January 2014 signalled the start of the formal accession process, setting out areas of reform Serbia needed to complete before being accepted as a member.

Serbia’s accession is particularly important for regional stability, given its size and role in past conflicts. If the EU is a project that wants to deliver peace and stability, it is difficult to see this as being successful in the western Balkans without including Serbia.

But talks have been far from smooth. Neighbouring Croatia which was earmarked by the EU as a future member at the same time as Serbia, in 2003, became a full EU member in 2013, but Serbian negotiations to become part of the EU have edged forward slowly. There is also a challenge with 40% of Serbs favouring an end to membership talks.

Vučić’s efforts to seek favour with Moscow will harm his country’s chances","(1) [Serbia's EU Aspirations]  
Serbia stands at a pivotal juncture in its aspirations to join the European Union, grappling with the choice between deeper integration with the EU and maintaining its historical ties with Russia. Although the EU represents potential prosperity, Serbia's recent actions and political climate raise concerns about its commitment to EU standards, especially following elections criticized for not meeting expected norms for candidacy. #  

(2) [Russia's Influence]  
Russia's enduring influence in Serbia is evident, as President Vučić has recently procured military equipment from Moscow and publicly rejected EU sanctions against Russia. This alignment with Russia is not only a reflection of Serbia's historical ties but also serves Russia's broader strategy to counteract Western influence in the Balkans. The perception of Russia as a ""great friend"" among many Serbs complicates Serbia's path toward EU integration. #  

(3) [Regional Distrust]  
Non-Serb populations in the Western Balkans express significant distrust towards Russia, influenced by its historical support for Serbia during conflicts and its geopolitical maneuvers, such as vetoing UN resolutions on the Srebrenica massacre. This skepticism is heightened by Russia's recent actions in Ukraine, which reinforce fears about its intentions in the region. #  

(4) [EU's Peace Agenda]  
The EU originally emerged as a peace project in the wake of World War II, and its expansion into the Western Balkans, including Serbia, is crucial for regional stability. However, Serbia's sluggish accession process and the internal public sentiment against continued EU negotiations pose challenges to this peace agenda, suggesting that without Serbia's integration, lasting stability in the region may remain elusive. #  

(5) [Vučić's Political Maneuvering]  
President Vučić’s political strategies, including his cooperation with Russia and his dismissive treatment of protests, threaten Serbia's EU membership prospects. His approach reflects a balancing act between appeasing Moscow and navigating the EU's expectations, which could ultimately hinder Serbia's integration efforts and its role in fostering regional peace. #",Serbia's EU Aspirations,"Serbia stands at a pivotal juncture in its aspirations to join the European Union, grappling with the choice between deeper integration with the EU and maintaining its historical ties with Russia.

Serbia’s accession is particularly important for regional stability, given its size and role in past conflicts. If the EU is a project that wants to deliver peace and stability, it is difficult to see this as being successful in the western Balkans without including Serbia.

But talks have been far from smooth. Neighbouring Croatia which was earmarked by the EU as a future member at the same time as Serbia, in 2003, became a full EU member in 2013, but Serbian negotiations to become part of the EU have edged forward slowly. There is also a challenge with 40% of Serbs favouring an end to membership talks.

Vučić’s efforts to seek favour with Moscow will harm his country’s chances","(1) [Serbia's EU Aspirations]  
Serbia stands at a pivotal juncture in its aspirations to join the European Union, grappling with the choice between deeper integration with the EU and maintaining its historical ties with Russia. Although the EU represents potential prosperity, Serbia's recent actions and political climate raise concerns about its commitment to EU standards, especially following elections criticized for not meeting expected norms for candidacy. #  

(2) [Russia's Influence]  
Russia's enduring influence in Serbia is evident, as President Vučić has recently procured military equipment from Moscow and publicly rejected EU sanctions against Russia. This alignment with Russia is not only a reflection of Serbia's historical ties but also serves Russia's broader strategy to counteract Western influence in the Balkans. The perception of Russia as a ""great friend"" among many Serbs complicates Serbia's path toward EU integration. #  

(3) [Regional Distrust]  
Non-Serb populations in the Western Balkans express significant distrust towards Russia, influenced by its historical support for Serbia during conflicts and its geopolitical maneuvers, such as vetoing UN resolutions on the Srebrenica massacre. This skepticism is heightened by Russia's recent actions in Ukraine, which reinforce fears about its intentions in the region. #  

(4) [EU's Peace Agenda]  
The EU originally emerged as a peace project in the wake of World War II, and its expansion into the Western Balkans, including Serbia, is crucial for regional stability. However, Serbia's sluggish accession process and the internal public sentiment against continued EU negotiations pose challenges to this peace agenda, suggesting that without Serbia's integration, lasting stability in the region may remain elusive. #  

(5) [Vučić's Political Maneuvering]  
President Vučić’s political strategies, including his cooperation with Russia and his dismissive treatment of protests, threaten Serbia's EU membership prospects. His approach reflects a balancing act between appeasing Moscow and navigating the EU's expectations, which could ultimately hinder Serbia's integration efforts and its role in fostering regional peace. #",EU's Peace Agenda,"The EU originally emerged as a peace project in the wake of World War II, and its expansion into the Western Balkans, including Serbia, is crucial for regional stability.

Russia: Serbia’s history is key to understanding its close relationship with Moscow - theconversation.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQalVIRGxjb1hSbTl0djMyVzd2c09UVzRFUkk0Nm8xajMzY1hpb05sUHBWaEZhNUE3c3dQME16SE56c1VSYVJET3hJQ005WDl3Vnc4QW85QnhlUU5lR2hYNDd0NjM5Y0Z5SUd0UnRPS2d2ZFUtNDdna3ZfdkFMR1pxOTRYOGdRckV1WkhxWHNIQms4ZUdnSlVfT2VZU2VQZWVCdTRJdVFqNi1LX3lrUkNLVUxZMGdERkE?oc=5,theconversation.com,2024-02-27,https://theconversation.com/russia-serbias-history-is-key-to-understanding-its-close-relationship-with-moscow-223601,"Over the past few weeks, international attention has focused on Ukraine in the run-up to the second anniversary of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. But Ukraine is not the only part of Europe where Russia is seeking to assert its influence and control.

Often overlooked by the international community in a world beset by international crises, Serbia, another aspiring member of the European Union, finds itself at a crossroads between pursuing its future within the bloc or staying within Moscow’s orbit.

Despite the promise of greater prosperity within the EU, many fear that Serbia is moving closer to the Kremlin again. Indeed, Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić announced in February that he had purchased an anti-drone system, combat vehicles and infantry equipment from Russia.

The country has been historically close to Russia. In modern times, this relationship was cemented by Russia backing Serbia’s opposition to Kosovan independence. The Kremlin was against the province becoming an independent nation and suggested this would be a breach of international law.

Russia remains popular among many Serbs, and the country has refused to follow the rest of Europe in imposing sanctions on its old ally over the Ukraine invasion.

Many non-Serbs in the western Balkans distrust Russia, particularly because of its long-term support for Serbia – and those fears were exacerbated by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Indeed, before the invasion Russia showed whose side it was on in the Balkans when Moscow wielded its UN Security Council veto in 2015 to prevent a resolution that would have recognised the Srebrenica massacres as genocide on the 20th anniversary of those atrocities during the Balkan war. Around 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered in Srebrenica.

The narrative of genocide denial in the Russian media was even used to counter accusations of atrocities by Russian forces in Ukraine, notably Bucha. A report on Russian state-controlled First TV said:

Recall that [Srebrenica] has become synonymous with the genocide of the Muslim population, which, according to the west, was committed by the Bosnian Serbs in July 1995. But over time, many facts appeared confirming that a well-planned operation was carried out in Srebrenica, behind which stood western intelligence services.

Russia has long had a role in the western Balkans and sees its partnership with Serbia as a means of countering western influence in the region. This means Russia pulling Serbia away from forging closer ties with the EU and as former US ambassador to Nato, Kurt Volker, said at the time: “Moscow wants to make it clear that the Balkans won’t be part of mainstream Europe.”

Recent elections in Serbia, condemned by EU observers as being “below the expected standards for an EU candidate country”, added to concerns especially when demonstrators were condemned as “thugs” by Vučić , who thanked the Russians for tipping him off in advance that the protests were taking place.

Serbia also refuses to align with the rest of Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia with Vučić recently telling Tass, Russia’s state-run news agency: “You have many friends in Europe, but they all imposed sanctions against you. The only country that did not introduce sanctions is little Serbia.”

Vučić has also signed cooperation agreements with Moscow. Russia’s soft power remains strong in the country where the population regards Russia as its “greatest friend” and one survey found 63% blame the west for Russia’s war in Ukraine.

EU and the Balkans

The EU is at its heart a peace process, first formed from the carnage of the second world war. That peace was shattered by the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the genocide that took place during the conflict, notably during the war in Bosnia. That failure still haunts EU decision makers.

In June 2003 at the EU Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki in Greece, European leaders decided to identify the countries of the region, as potential candidates for membership, including Serbia.

In September 2013 a stabilisation and association agreement between Serbia and the EU came into force. A conference in January 2014 signalled the start of the formal accession process, setting out areas of reform Serbia needed to complete before being accepted as a member.

On one side, the West promises a new chance for prosperity and stability. On the other side, Russia offers familiarity and protection. However, Serbia's fragmented media environment has allowed Russian propaganda tactics to take hold, convincing the Serbian public that siding with Russia is more beneficial than siding with the West. Serbia occupies a key strategic point between Eastern and Western Europe, thus making it a point of great interest and concern for the United States. If the United States is to counteract Russian propaganda and accomplish its foreign policy goal of seeing a stable Serbia integrated into European institutions, then the United States must do more to support independent journalism and media literacy in Serbia.

A Look Back

The end of the conflicts and eventual breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s presented its successor states with an opportunity to shape a new pathway forward. As a result, several states, such as Croatia and Montenegro, joined the EU and NATO, respectively. Serbia, however, has found itself conflicted between the West and Russia.

Many Serbs remember the events of 1999 as if they happened yesterday. In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, NATO initiated air operations against Serbia for its aggression in Kosovo. Over 20 years later, many Serbs still resent NATO, and particularly the United States, for the campaign. Russia, however, had vocally opposed the campaign. To further sour the relations between the United States and Serbia, in 2008, the United States recognized Kosovo’s independence. On the other hand, Russia has declined to recognize Kosovo’s independence. As a result of these two factors, Serbian public opinion toward the United States tends to be unfavorable. According to a Serbian public opinion survey conducted by the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, 13 percent of respondents believed that the United States was Serbia’s biggest enemy, putting it in third place behind its former Yugoslav counterpart, Croatia, and neighboring Albania. When asked “Which country is Serbia’s best-friend?” 40 percent of respondents said Russia.

In 2012, the EU recognized Serbia as a candidate for membership, but the joining process has been slow. Two alleged, but unconfirmed, reasons for this are that Serbia has yet to normalize relations with Kosovo and that Serbia has not issued sanctions against Russia. According to the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy survey, 51 percent of respondents believed that Serbia should join the EU, but 46 percent believed it should not, reflecting the split position of the country.

The Perfect Storm

The current media environment in Serbia has created a perfect storm of misinformation and pro-Russian sentiments. Several Russian media outlets, such as RT and Sputnik, are present in Serbia and offer programming in the Serbian language. Russian media outlets are highly skilled in exploiting cultural, historical, and political factors in favor of Russia and presenting both the United States and the West broadly as the enemy. In addition to Russian misinformation, Serbia's media environment is characterized by tabloidization and little investigative journalism, thus creating an ideal environment for spreading anti-Western and pro-Russian views. The Center for Insights in Survey Research found that 36 percent of respondents believed that in Serbia, ""the major media is not concerned with factual and correct reporting of a story, but instead is focused on propagating positions that serve some particular interest."" For example, on February 22, 2022, Serbian tabloid magazine, Informer, released the headlines ""Ukraine attacked Russia"" and ""America is pushing the world into chaos,"" two days before the war in Ukraine started.

To counteract Russian misinformation, Western media such as Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Voice of America (VOA) also present their views in the Serbian media. However, they are not as popular or readily accessible as pro-Russian sources. For example, in April 2022, Radio Free Europe's Balkan Service published an article titled ""U.S. Senators Urge Serbian President To Impose Sanctions On Russia."" However, pro-Russian and pro-government political tabloids continue to be highly popular and easily accessible, at less than 20 cents per copy.

The Time to Act is Now

With the war in Ukraine in its fourth month and no end in sight, Serbia must decide which path it will follow. Though Russia appears to be winning in the game of influence in Serbia, the United States can still work to support a healthy media environment free from Russia's misinformation.

On March 2, the United Nations General Assembly held a vote for a resolution to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine. Serbia was one of 140 countries to vote in favor of the resolution. Despite this, Serbia has continued to decline issuing sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

According to the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy survey, 51 percent of respondents believed that Serbia should join the EU, but 46 percent believed it should not, reflecting the split position of the country.

The Perfect Storm

The current media environment in Serbia has created a perfect storm of misinformation and pro-Russian sentiments. Several Russian media outlets, such as RT and Sputnik, are present in Serbia and offer programming in the Serbian language. Russian media outlets are highly skilled in exploiting cultural, historical, and political factors in favor of Russia and presenting both the United States and the West broadly as the enemy. In addition to Russian misinformation, Serbia's media environment is characterized by tabloidization and little investigative journalism, thus creating an ideal environment for spreading anti-Western and pro-Russian views. The Center for Insights in Survey Research found that 36 percent of respondents believed that in Serbia, ""the major media is not concerned with factual and correct reporting of a story, but instead is focused on propagating positions that serve some particular interest."" For example, on February 22, 2022, Serbian tabloid magazine, Informer, released the headlines ""Ukraine attacked Russia"" and ""America is pushing the world into chaos,"" two days before the war in Ukraine started.

To counteract Russian misinformation, Western media such as Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Voice of America (VOA) also present their views in the Serbian media. However, they are not as popular or readily accessible as pro-Russian sources. For example, in April 2022, Radio Free Europe's Balkan Service published an article titled ""U.S. Senators Urge Serbian President To Impose Sanctions On Russia."" However, pro-Russian and pro-government political tabloids continue to be highly popular and easily accessible, at less than 20 cents per copy.

The Time to Act is Now

With the war in Ukraine in its fourth month and no end in sight, Serbia must decide which path it will follow. Though Russia appears to be winning in the game of influence in Serbia, the United States can still work to support a healthy media environment free from Russia's misinformation.

On March 2, the United Nations General Assembly held a vote for a resolution to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine. Serbia was one of 140 countries to vote in favor of the resolution. Despite this, Serbia has continued to decline issuing sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

On one side, the West promises a new chance for prosperity and stability. On the other side, Russia offers familiarity and protection. However, Serbia's fragmented media environment has allowed Russian propaganda tactics to take hold, convincing the Serbian public that siding with Russia is more beneficial than siding with the West. Serbia occupies a key strategic point between Eastern and Western Europe, thus making it a point of great interest and concern for the United States. If the United States is to counteract Russian propaganda and accomplish its foreign policy goal of seeing a stable Serbia integrated into European institutions, then the United States must do more to support independent journalism and media literacy in Serbia.

A Look Back

The end of the conflicts and eventual breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s presented its successor states with an opportunity to shape a new pathway forward. As a result, several states, such as Croatia and Montenegro, joined the EU and NATO, respectively. Serbia, however, has found itself conflicted between the West and Russia.

Many Serbs remember the events of 1999 as if they happened yesterday. In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, NATO initiated air operations against Serbia for its aggression in Kosovo. Over 20 years later, many Serbs still resent NATO, and particularly the United States, for the campaign. Russia, however, had vocally opposed the campaign. To further sour the relations between the United States and Serbia, in 2008, the United States recognized Kosovo’s independence. On the other hand, Russia has declined to recognize Kosovo’s independence. As a result of these two factors, Serbian public opinion toward the United States tends to be unfavorable. According to a Serbian public opinion survey conducted by the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, 13 percent of respondents believed that the United States was Serbia’s biggest enemy, putting it in third place behind its former Yugoslav counterpart, Croatia, and neighboring Albania. When asked “Which country is Serbia’s best-friend?” 40 percent of respondents said Russia.

In 2012, the EU recognized Serbia as a candidate for membership, but the joining process has been slow. Two alleged, but unconfirmed, reasons for this are that Serbia has yet to normalize relations with Kosovo and that Serbia has not issued sanctions against Russia. According to the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy survey, 51 percent of respondents believed that Serbia should join the EU, but 46 percent believed it should not, reflecting the split position of the country.

China and Serbia share a close partnership, symbolized by their enduring “iron friendship”. Serbia is also the first European nation to embrace the concept of a “community of shared future” with China, reinforcing their bond and mutual aspirations for a harmonious global landscape.

UPDATE (June 28, 2024): The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council released an announcement on June 27, 2024, regarding the application of agreed tax rates for certain goods originating in Serbia. As a result of negotiations between China and Serbia, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries will take effect on July 1, 2024. According to the announcement, China will apply the agreed tax rates to eligible goods from Serbia starting from the effective date.

In recent years, China and Serbia have significantly strengthened their relationship, enhancing both economic and political ties. Often referred to as an “iron friendship,” this close partnership has made China a key ally for Serbia. Highlighting their deepening ties, Serbia became the first European country to agree to build a “community of shared future” with China, reflecting their growing collaboration.

China’s substantial investments in Serbia, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and strategic partnerships, underscore its crucial role in Serbia’s development. In return, Serbia serves as a vital entry point for China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Europe, boosting China’s influence in the region.

In this article, we discuss the latest data on bilateral trade and investment between China and Serbia. Additionally, we provide an overview of the various tax and investment treaties signed by the two countries, offering insights into the legal framework that underpins their economic relationship.

China-Serbia relations

China and Serbia have enjoyed a longstanding diplomatic relationship, dating back to 1955 when China established diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia, Serbia’s predecessor. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Chinese Embassy in former Yugoslavia was renamed the Chinese Embassy in Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and then the Chinese Embassy in the Republic of Serbia in 2006.

The partnership between the two nations deepened over time, culminating in the establishment of a strategic partnership in 2009. In the following years, the bilateral relationship continued to strengthen, as evidenced by the signing of the Joint Statement on Deepening Strategic Partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Serbia in 2013, and of the Joint Statement on the Establishment of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Serbia in 2016.

Recent developments

During a meeting in February 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the enduring “iron-clad friendship” between the two nations highlighting the robust mutual political trust that has withstood the test of time, particularly through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On October 17, 2023, President Xi and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić met in Beijing for the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. On this occasion, they celebrated the signing of several key bilateral agreements, including a historic Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This agreement aims to boost trade and collaboration in sectors such as automotive, technology, agriculture, and commodities. As the first FTA between China and a Central and Eastern European nation, it makes Serbia China’s 29th FTA partner. By eliminating tariffs on many goods, the agreement is expected to significantly impact European and Eurasian trade dynamics, highlighting their commitment to mutually beneficial relations. The FTA negotiations, completed in just five months, reflect the high level of political trust between the two countries.

While signing the Free Trade Agreement is perceived as a major event, Serbia is only seeing this as a first step in deepening the relationship between the two countries, as China has committed to support Serbia in hosting Expo 2027 and increase imports of high-quality agricultural products from Serbia, including dried plums and blueberries. Lastly, China will facilitate the training of young Serbian scientists over the next three years and provide further educational opportunities in China, while encouraging airlines to open direct flights from Belgrade to Guangzhou. – Radomir Tomovic, Manager, International Business Advisory in Hong Kong, Dezan Shira & Associates.

During his most recent trip to Europe in May 2024, President Xi met with President Vučić in Belgrade, where they agreed to follow a “shared future” as they signed 29 agreements to enhance legal, regulatory, and economic cooperation. The visit carried symbolic significance, occurring on the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.

Highlighting their deepening ties, Serbia became the first European country to agree to build a “community of shared future” with China, reflecting their growing collaboration.

China’s substantial investments in Serbia, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and strategic partnerships, underscore its crucial role in Serbia’s development. In return, Serbia serves as a vital entry point for China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Europe, boosting China’s influence in the region.

In this article, we discuss the latest data on bilateral trade and investment between China and Serbia. Additionally, we provide an overview of the various tax and investment treaties signed by the two countries, offering insights into the legal framework that underpins their economic relationship.

China-Serbia relations

China and Serbia have enjoyed a longstanding diplomatic relationship, dating back to 1955 when China established diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia, Serbia’s predecessor. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Chinese Embassy in former Yugoslavia was renamed the Chinese Embassy in Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and then the Chinese Embassy in the Republic of Serbia in 2006.

The partnership between the two nations deepened over time, culminating in the establishment of a strategic partnership in 2009. In the following years, the bilateral relationship continued to strengthen, as evidenced by the signing of the Joint Statement on Deepening Strategic Partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Serbia in 2013, and of the Joint Statement on the Establishment of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Serbia in 2016.

Recent developments

During a meeting in February 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the enduring “iron-clad friendship” between the two nations highlighting the robust mutual political trust that has withstood the test of time, particularly through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On October 17, 2023, President Xi and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić met in Beijing for the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. On this occasion, they celebrated the signing of several key bilateral agreements, including a historic Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This agreement aims to boost trade and collaboration in sectors such as automotive, technology, agriculture, and commodities. As the first FTA between China and a Central and Eastern European nation, it makes Serbia China’s 29th FTA partner. By eliminating tariffs on many goods, the agreement is expected to significantly impact European and Eurasian trade dynamics, highlighting their commitment to mutually beneficial relations. The FTA negotiations, completed in just five months, reflect the high level of political trust between the two countries.

While signing the Free Trade Agreement is perceived as a major event, Serbia is only seeing this as a first step in deepening the relationship between the two countries, as China has committed to support Serbia in hosting Expo 2027 and increase imports of high-quality agricultural products from Serbia, including dried plums and blueberries. Lastly, China will facilitate the training of young Serbian scientists over the next three years and provide further educational opportunities in China, while encouraging airlines to open direct flights from Belgrade to Guangzhou. – Radomir Tomovic, Manager, International Business Advisory in Hong Kong, Dezan Shira & Associates.

Several Serbian ministries announced on July 10 that the country is weighing whether to end the 35-year-old, Yugoslav-era ban on nuclear reactors and said public debate was being opened on the shake-up of Belgrade’s long-standing energy policy.

If successful, the Serbian government could also find itself on a new geopolitical fault line involving nuclear energy in Eastern Europe as countries look to move away from relying on Russia -- which has dominated the nuclear energy sector -- and consider alternative partnerships with countries like China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is looking to navigate the new realities created by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and deploy the same hedging strategy for the country’s nuclear future that’s been used by Belgrade to play the United States and the European Union against Russia and China on a host of security and foreign policy issues.

“Even though Serbia has not been hard on Russia like the European Union has, it’s looking to preserve a balancing act with the West,” Stefan Vladisavljev, program director at Foundation BFPE, a Belgrade-based think tank, told RFE/RL. “That means distancing away from Russia for big strategic projects, but where exactly that leads Belgrade remains to be seen.”

Prior to the start of Russia’s February 2022 war, Serbia relied on cheap local labor and discounted Russian gas to make its mining and manufacturing industries competitive and attractive to investors. But Western sanctions and market turbulence have increased the price of Russian gas and seen Brussels and Washington attach a political price tag to making new deals with Russian companies.

That leaves Vucic walking a tightrope between the need to improve Serbia’s energy security by adding nuclear power and the geopolitical considerations brought by the country Belgrade decides to partner with.

Serbian officials have actively weighed their options, having already held meetings with Britain’s Rolls-Royce and France’s state-owned Electricite de France (EDF), in April, when a memo was signed “assessing the potential for the development of the civil nuclear program in Serbia.”

In June, the Energy Ministry said it is “laying the groundwork” for an assessment on partnering with EDF.

EDF did not respond to RFE/RL’s requests for details on what cooperation with Serbia would entail but, in the meantime, China has also entered the mix.

The state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation’s (CNNC) could supply small modular reactors (SMRs), which proponents say are less cumbersome to build and may better suit a country like Serbia’s more modest nuclear power needs.

Another option involves buying a stake in the still under construction Paks 2 nuclear power plant -- a joint Hungarian-Russian project launched in 2014 that is 100 kilometers southwest of Budapest -- which could then send power south to Serbia.

The Serbian Energy Ministry told RFE/RL in a statement that it is currently exploring all potential partnerships.

“After changing the legislative framework, Serbia will analyze the potential for cooperation at the regional and international level with countries that already have a developed nuclear program, both with China as well as with France, the United States, Russia, Japan, and other relevant countries,” it said.



The New Nuclear Chessboard

While Russia has lost its dominant position in oil and gas exports since the 2022 start of the Ukraine war, it continues to be the biggest player globally in providing nuclear fuel, accounting for more than 40 percent of the global market. Russia also has a complete monopoly on the production of advanced nuclear fuel that will be needed to power the next generation of nuclear reactors.

For countries with Russian-made reactors this dependence runs even deeper, with Russia’s state-owned nuclear power giant Rosatom operating 18 reactors across the EU, the bulk of them in Central and Eastern Europe.

This reliance has so far left Rosatom and Russian nuclear materials off sanctions packages passed in Brussels, but the United States, Britain, France, and important Western nuclear fuel providers have announced plans to expand their own capacity to enrich uranium and build reactors across Europe.

It’s against this backdrop that Belgrade must make a decision and plan for the long-term implications. Currently, Serbia gets almost 70 percent of its electricity from coal, but has committed to completely phase it out by 2050. Incorporating nuclear power along with more green energy is necessary to meet that goal.

“Where a country gets its reactor from is extremely important and keeps them tied together,” Jennifer Gordon, the director of the Atlantic Council's Nuclear ","(1) [Energy Policy] Serbia is reconsidering its long-standing ban on nuclear power plants as part of a strategic shift to reduce reliance on Russian gas and enhance energy security. The government has engaged in public discussions to evaluate the potential for nuclear energy development, signifying a significant policy transformation. # 

(2) [Geopolitical Strategy] President Aleksandar Vucic is navigating complex geopolitical dynamics, balancing Serbia's energy needs with the necessity of distancing from Russia amid Western pressures. The exploration of partnerships with countries such as the UK and France reflects Serbia's intent to diversify its energy sources while maintaining a strategic equilibrium with both Western and Eastern powers. # 

(3) [International Partnerships] Serbia is actively exploring collaborations with key international players in the nuclear sector, including the UK's Rolls-Royce and France's EDF, indicating a shift towards developing its civil nuclear program. This exploration is critical as Serbia seeks to develop a sustainable energy framework while evaluating options from various nations, including China, for potential nuclear technology partnerships. #

(4) [Nuclear Market Dynamics] The global nuclear landscape is shifting, particularly in the wake of Russia's diminished role in oil and gas exports, yet its dominance in the nuclear fuel market persists. Serbia must consider the long-term implications of its nuclear partnerships, especially given the existing reliance on Russian nuclear technology in the region, while also preparing for a future that includes the diversification of energy sources and the reduction of coal dependency. # 

(5) [Energy Transition] With Serbia's commitment to phasing out coal by 2050, integrating nuclear energy is essential for meeting future electricity demands. The transition to nuclear, alongside renewable energy sources, is crucial for Serbia to achieve its climate goals and ensure energy independence, necessitating careful planning and international cooperation in the nuclear sector. #",Energy Policy,"Serbia is reconsidering its long-standing ban on nuclear power plants as part of a strategic shift to reduce reliance on Russian gas and enhance energy security.

Several Serbian ministries announced on July 10 that the country is weighing whether to end the 35-year-old, Yugoslav-era ban on nuclear reactors and said public debate was being opened on the shake-up of Belgrade’s long-standing energy policy.

If successful, the Serbian government could also find itself on a new geopolitical fault line involving nuclear energy in Eastern Europe as countries look to move away from relying on Russia -- which has dominated the nuclear energy sector -- and consider alternative partnerships with countries like China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is looking to navigate the new realities created by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and deploy the same hedging strategy for the country’s nuclear future that’s been used by Belgrade to play the United States and the European Union against Russia and China on a host of security and foreign policy issues.

“Even though Serbia has not been hard on Russia like the European Union has, it’s looking to preserve a balancing act with the West,” Stefan Vladisavljev, program director at Foundation BFPE, a Belgrade-based think tank, told RFE/RL. “That means distancing away from Russia for big strategic projects, but where exactly that leads Belgrade remains to be seen.”

Prior to the start of Russia’s February 2022 war, Serbia relied on cheap local labor and discounted Russian gas to make its mining and manufacturing industries competitive and attractive to investors. But Western sanctions and market turbulence have increased the price of Russian gas and seen Brussels and Washington attach a political price tag to making new deals with Russian companies.

That leaves Vucic walking a tightrope between the need to improve Serbia’s energy security by adding nuclear power and the geopolitical considerations brought by the country Belgrade decides to partner with.

Serbian officials have actively weighed their options, having already held meetings with Britain’s Rolls-Royce and France’s state-owned Electricite de France (EDF), in April, when a memo was signed “assessing the potential for the development of the civil nuclear program in Serbia.”

In June, the Energy Ministry said it is “laying the groundwork” for an assessment on partnering with EDF.

EDF did not respond to RFE/RL’s requests for details on what cooperation with Serbia would entail but, in the meantime, China has also entered the mix.

The state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation’s (CNNC) could supply small modular reactors (SMRs), which proponents say are less cumbersome to build and may better suit a country like Serbia’s more modest nuclear power needs.

Another option involves buying a stake in the still under construction Paks 2 nuclear power plant -- a joint Hungarian-Russian project launched in 2014 that is 100 kilometers southwest of Budapest -- which could then send power south to Serbia.

The Serbian Energy Ministry told RFE/RL in a statement that it is currently exploring all potential partnerships.

“After changing the legislative framework, Serbia will analyze the potential for cooperation at the regional and international level with countries that already have a developed nuclear program, both with China as well as with France, the United States, Russia, Japan, and other relevant countries,” it said.



The New Nuclear Chessboard

While Russia has lost its dominant position in oil and gas exports since the 2022 start of the Ukraine war, it continues to be the biggest player globally in providing nuclear fuel, accounting for more than 40 percent of the global market. Russia also has a complete monopoly on the production of advanced nuclear fuel that will be needed to power the next generation of nuclear reactors.

For countries with Russian-made reactors this dependence runs even deeper, with Russia’s state-owned nuclear power giant Rosatom operating 18 reactors across the EU, the bulk of them in Central and Eastern Europe.

This reliance has so far left Rosatom and Russian nuclear materials off sanctions packages passed in Brussels, but the United States, Britain, France, and important Western nuclear fuel providers have announced plans to expand their own capacity to enrich uranium and build reactors across Europe.

It’s against this backdrop that Belgrade must make a decision and plan for the long-term implications. Currently, Serbia gets almost 70 percent of its electricity from coal, but has committed to completely phase it out by 2050. Incorporating nuclear power along with more green energy is necessary to meet that goal.

Vance has been sharply critical of Brussels over its decision to withhold funds from Hungary and Poland over democracy and rule of law concerns.

“You know, the EU has kept billions of dollars of promised aid away from Hungary, because of its views on Ukraine. It captured billions of dollars of promised aid from a previous government in Poland, because of the conservative Polish government’s views,” he said in an interview in February.

“That’s not a rules-based order. That’s Europe, from Brussels and Berlin, imposing liberal imperialistic views on the rest of the continent.”

On Hungary

Much like Trump, Vance has spoken highly of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and proposed taking a leaf out of his book on social policy.

“In Hungary under Orbán, they offer loans to newly married couples that are forgiven at some point later if those couples have actually stayed together and had kids. Why can’t we do that here? Why can’t we actually promote family formation?” he told a conservative thinktank in 2021.

Vance also called for the “de-woke-ification” of schools and cited Orbán as inspiration in an appearance on a right-wing podcast last September.","(1) [EU Relations]  
Vance has expressed strong criticism of the European Union's decision to withhold financial aid to Hungary and Poland, linking it to their governance styles and views on democracy. He characterizes these actions as a form of ""liberal imperialism,"" suggesting that Brussels and Berlin are imposing their ideologies on member states rather than adhering to a genuine rules-based order. #  

(2) [Hungary's Leadership]  
Vance has shown admiration for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, citing his social policy initiatives as a model for the U.S. He highlights Orbán’s innovative family support programs, such as loan forgiveness for newly married couples, advocating for similar policies in the United States to promote family formation. Vance's alignment with Orbán also extends to educational reforms, advocating for a “de-woke-ification” of schools, drawing further inspiration from Hungary’s leadership. #  

(3) [Democracy Concerns]  
The withholding of EU funds from Hungary and Poland has raised significant concerns about the implications for democracy and governance in the region. Vance’s critique implies a belief that such financial penalties undermine the sovereignty of these nations and could lead to broader tensions between EU institutions and member states that diverge from mainstream liberal values. #  

(4) [Cultural Policy]  
Vance's reference to “de-woke-ification” reflects a growing sentiment among certain political factions that seek to counter progressive ideologies in education and social policy. This stance aligns him with Orbán's approach to cultural conservatism, indicating a potential shift in U.S. policy discussions towards a more conservative framework influenced by foreign examples. #  

(5) [Political Ideology]  
Vance's positions underscore a broader ideological battle within the transatlantic relationship, where the clash between liberal and conservative values is becoming increasingly pronounced. His emphasis on Orbán's policies suggests a possible realignment of political narratives that prioritize national sovereignty and conservative social policies over EU-led frameworks. #",Political Ideology,"Vance's positions underscore a broader ideological battle within the transatlantic relationship, where the clash between liberal and conservative values is becoming increasingly pronounced.

× In a nutshell China is focusing on Hungary and Serbia as strategic European outposts

Western Europe is more important for Chinese investment, trade relations

China’s enabling of Russian aggression is reducing its regional influence

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping’s May visit to France, Serbia and Hungary reveals much about how Beijing has modified its approach to Europe over the last five years. The selection of stops in his first trip to the region since 2019 focused on countries that consolidate strategic gains or offer special opportunities. Serbia and Hungary have been particularly receptive to China’s policy priorities in key strategic locations and France always seeks a greater international leadership role.

After years of setbacks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Beijing has been focusing on cementing relations with its most promising partners in the region: European Union and NATO member Hungary, and unaffiliated but pro-Russian Serbia. In both countries, Beijing enjoys particularly favorable political and economic conditions. Past investments and diplomatic attention there are paying off nicely, offering China special opportunities to use these relationships as more robust bridgeheads and wedges into the continent.

Nevertheless, China’s presence – and influence – remains stronger in Western Europe, where its foreign direct investment and trade flows are much larger. Investment from Western Europe into China is also much larger and their economies are more dependent on the Chinese market, making them more vulnerable to coercion.

Less favorable political context

China’s brand in CEE is much diminished from 2019, not to mention the early 2010s, when countries across the region sought closer economic relations and were particularly open to more engagement through the then new Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Most are now much less receptive to China’s messaging and engagement, even as the countries President Xi visited are keen to deepen ties across the board.

The former 17+1 format, a forum established in 2012 to expand investment, trade and infrastructure cooperation between China and countries in the region, has been moribund since Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia quit in 2021 and 2022. The last summit of the reduced 14+1 grouping in February 2021 was an embarrassing failure for China, after six countries declined to participate at the head of government level and to endorse a joint communique. The BRI, which once counted 11 EU member states as signatories, has also lost much support. Hungary and Serbia were the only European states to participate in the 2023 BRI Forum.

Most countries in Central Europe have de-emphasized their engagement with Beijing over the last five years, viewing China as having overpromised and underdelivered on trade and investment. Trade flows remain overwhelmingly in China’s benefit and leaders throughout the region consider Beijing to have badly mishandled the pandemic. They view the BRI and similar multilateral formats as photo ops devoid of substance, while considering bilateral engagements as necessary primarily to advance narrow economic goals, rather than to grow political or other ties.

× Facts & figures A look at China’s engagement focused on Central Europe

Many Central European countries are also concerned about China’s growing exports of subsidized electric vehicles at the expense of the European automobile industry, a critical part of most regional economies given their integral connection to German and other manufacturers. Most regional leaders are turned off by Beijing’s aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy.

Perhaps most importantly, however, heads of governments and states in Central Europe are alarmed by Beijing’s “no-limits” friendship with Moscow and its large and growing support for Russia’s war against Ukraine. The joint communique Mr. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed just before the February 2022 full-scale invasion calling for NATO to roll back to its 1997 borders was a direct challenge to their membership in the alliance that guarantees their security in the post-1989 European order. Officials expressed these concerns to Chinese envoy Huo Yuzhen who in May 2022 visited eight countries in the region, while the Polish government refused a meeting on the grounds that Warsaw views the bilateral relationship primarily through a national security prism, namely China enabling Russia’s war.

× In a nutshell China is focusing on Hungary and Serbia as strategic European outposts

Western Europe is more important for Chinese investment, trade relations

China’s enabling of Russian aggression is reducing its regional influence

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping’s May visit to France, Serbia and Hungary reveals much about how Beijing has modified its approach to Europe over the last five years. The selection of stops in his first trip to the region since 2019 focused on countries that consolidate strategic gains or offer special opportunities. Serbia and Hungary have been particularly receptive to China’s policy priorities in key strategic locations and France always seeks a greater international leadership role.

After years of setbacks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Beijing has been focusing on cementing relations with its most promising partners in the region: European Union and NATO member Hungary, and unaffiliated but pro-Russian Serbia. In both countries, Beijing enjoys particularly favorable political and economic conditions. Past investments and diplomatic attention there are paying off nicely, offering China special opportunities to use these relationships as more robust bridgeheads and wedges into the continent.

Nevertheless, China’s presence – and influence – remains stronger in Western Europe, where its foreign direct investment and trade flows are much larger. Investment from Western Europe into China is also much larger and their economies are more dependent on the Chinese market, making them more vulnerable to coercion.

Less favorable political context

China’s brand in CEE is much diminished from 2019, not to mention the early 2010s, when countries across the region sought closer economic relations and were particularly open to more engagement through the then new Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Most are now much less receptive to China’s messaging and engagement, even as the countries President Xi visited are keen to deepen ties across the board.

The former 17+1 format, a forum established in 2012 to expand investment, trade and infrastructure cooperation between China and countries in the region, has been moribund since Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia quit in 2021 and 2022. The last summit of the reduced 14+1 grouping in February 2021 was an embarrassing failure for China, after six countries declined to participate at the head of government level and to endorse a joint communique. The BRI, which once counted 11 EU member states as signatories, has also lost much support. Hungary and Serbia were the only European states to participate in the 2023 BRI Forum.

Most countries in Central Europe have de-emphasized their engagement with Beijing over the last five years, viewing China as having overpromised and underdelivered on trade and investment. Trade flows remain overwhelmingly in China’s benefit and leaders throughout the region consider Beijing to have badly mishandled the pandemic. They view the BRI and similar multilateral formats as photo ops devoid of substance, while considering bilateral engagements as necessary primarily to advance narrow economic goals, rather than to grow political or other ties.

× Facts & figures A look at China’s engagement focused on Central Europe

Many Central European countries are also concerned about China’s growing exports of subsidized electric vehicles at the expense of the European automobile industry, a critical part of most regional economies given their integral connection to German and other manufacturers. Most regional leaders are turned off by Beijing’s aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy.

Perhaps most importantly, however, heads of governments and states in Central Europe are alarmed by Beijing’s “no-limits” friendship with Moscow and its large and growing support for Russia’s war against Ukraine. The joint communique Mr. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed just before the February 2022 full-scale invasion calling for NATO to roll back to its 1997 borders was a direct challenge to their membership in the alliance that guarantees their security in the post-1989 European order. Officials expressed these concerns to Chinese envoy Huo Yuzhen who in May 2022 visited eight countries in the region, while the Polish government refused a meeting on the grounds that Warsaw views the bilateral relationship primarily through a national security prism, namely China enabling Russia’s war.

China has strategically prioritized Hungary and Serbia as key partners in Central and Eastern Europe, using these nations as bridgeheads to strengthen its influence on the continent. Despite setbacks in the region, China sees favorable political and economic conditions in both countries, which have been receptive to its policy priorities. However, China’s overall influence remains greater in Western Europe due to larger investment and trade flows. #  

(2) [Hungary]  
Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has increasingly aligned itself with authoritarian regimes, particularly through its close ties with China and Russia. Orban's government is keen on cementing these relationships, evidenced by Hungary's participation in the 2023 Belt and Road Initiative Forum, showcasing its strategic importance to China amidst a broader regional decline in engagement. #  

(3) [Serbia]  
Serbia has positioned itself as a pro-Russian ally and is viewed as a crucial partner by China in Central and Eastern Europe. Its lack of affiliation with the EU and NATO allows it to pursue closer ties with Beijing, making it a focal point for Chinese investments and diplomatic efforts, despite growing concerns in the region regarding China's relationship with Russia. #  

(4) [Central Europe]  
Central European countries have grown increasingly skeptical of China, perceiving it as having overpromised on trade and investment while failing to deliver. Concerns about China's growing influence and its support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict have led to a de-emphasis in their engagement with Beijing, with regional leaders viewing interactions primarily through a national security lens. #

Fourteen years of Conservative-led governments came to an end after the July 4 general election, with the new Labour government ushering in a new era for redefining relations with both Brussels and specific EU member states. This EPC summit offered a unique lens into the current state of EU-UK relations, which – post-Brexit – now has a chance to build back better relations under a new Labour-led UK government.

The EPC was initially proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has been lauded as a new forum for discussing security and shared interests with a wide range of European leaders, both within and outside of the EU, while simultaneously being lambasted as a talkshop that fails to deliver meaningful progress. The previous summit in Granada, Spain was widely dismissed as a disappointment, in part due to heightened tensions between participating states–Armenia and Azerbaijan as well as Kosovo and Serbia–dashing any hopes for productive dialogue. Ahead of the last EPC summit it was also being proposed as an outer ring of EU gradual integration–not necessarily charting a path to membership but as a means of the EU exerting influence in its neighborhood. Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made headlines in Granada after insisting that the entire summit’s agenda be scrapped to focus solely on migration. This move was dismissed as theater for domestic politics. Following the lackluster takeaways of the previous summit, there was increased pressure on the UK-led summit.

The road to this summit has been particularly eventful. Initially planned for the first half of 2024, the summit was delayed due to domestic UK politics as general elections loomed large. On May 19, Prime Minister Sunak announced the summit would take place on July 18. A few days later, on May 22, Sunak called for the general election to be held on July 4–a mere two weeks before the EPC summit. Sunak’s government came to an end on July 4, replaced by a new Labour government led by Keir Starmer. Prime Minister Starmer found himself thrust into two high stakes international summits back-to-back: both the NATO Summit in Washington and hosting the EPC summit back home a week later.

Around 50 world leaders were expected to participate in this summit. In the end just over 40 heads of state and officials from the EU, the OSCE, and NATO attended. The venue, historic Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, is the birthplace of Winston Churchill. This year celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of the legendary leader, who famously suggested Europe should move towards becoming what he called “a United States of Europe.” His speech, delivered in 1946 as the continent rebuilt from a devastating war, seeded the ground for the European Union and deeper European integration. Churchill’s support for deepening cooperation within the “European family” – as he referred to it – continues on in spirit in the EPC format.

EU-UK relations are at a pivotal juncture, with high expectations of the new Labour government. Following the UK's referendum to leave the EU in 2016, an acrimonious Brexit ensued, instilling resentment and apprehension in Brussels, London, and several EU member capitals. These tense Brexit negotiations have been a dark cloud hanging over the EU-UK relationship. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, support for Ukraine rallied Europe's leaders, strengthening UK-France relations in particular. A return to normal communication as leaders coordinated aid packages seemed to prevail. Now, as elections rock both sides of the Atlantic and aid for Ukraine has slowed, the UK and EU must put aside past grievances to focus on the future, shared challenges facing Euro-Atlantic security, and their continued support of Ukraine. In an op-ed published in Le Monde, Starmer outlined the urgency of greater France-UK relations to address the numerous challenges facing Europe and European security.

Much attention has been paid to Prime Minister Starmer’s views towards the future of EU-UK relations. On the campaign trail, he made it clear he will not seek to have the UK rejoin the EU nor the single market. Instead, he has put forward his government would seek to remove trade barriers and deepen EU-UK security cooperation. Towards that goal, Starmer rallied leaders at the summit to crack down on Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers skirting international sanctions. David Lammy, the new Foreign Minister, claimed a Labour government would seek “a new geopolitical partnership with the EU” and is pursuing talks over an EU-UK security pact. John Healey, Labour’s new Defense Secretary, has been on the road since assuming the role, including a visit to Ukraine where he announced a major new military support package.

(3) [Security Cooperation]  
In light of ongoing challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the new UK government under Starmer is actively pursuing stronger security cooperation with the EU. Starmer's administration has emphasized the urgency of addressing geopolitical threats, particularly in relation to Russia, and has initiated discussions for an EU-UK security pact. This focus on collaboration reflects a commitment to overcoming past grievances and addressing shared security concerns. #

This move was dismissed as theater for domestic politics. Following the lackluster takeaways of the previous summit, there was increased pressure on the UK-led summit.

The road to this summit has been particularly eventful. Initially planned for the first half of 2024, the summit was delayed due to domestic UK politics as general elections loomed large. On May 19, Prime Minister Sunak announced the summit would take place on July 18. A few days later, on May 22, Sunak called for the general election to be held on July 4–a mere two weeks before the EPC summit. Sunak’s government came to an end on July 4, replaced by a new Labour government led by Keir Starmer. Prime Minister Starmer found himself thrust into two high stakes international summits back-to-back: both the NATO Summit in Washington and hosting the EPC summit back home a week later.

Around 50 world leaders were expected to participate in this summit. In the end just over 40 heads of state and officials from the EU, the OSCE, and NATO attended. The venue, historic Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, is the birthplace of Winston Churchill. This year celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of the legendary leader, who famously suggested Europe should move towards becoming what he called “a United States of Europe.” His speech, delivered in 1946 as the continent rebuilt from a devastating war, seeded the ground for the European Union and deeper European integration. Churchill’s support for deepening cooperation within the “European family” – as he referred to it – continues on in spirit in the EPC format.

EU-UK relations are at a pivotal juncture, with high expectations of the new Labour government. Following the UK's referendum to leave the EU in 2016, an acrimonious Brexit ensued, instilling resentment and apprehension in Brussels, London, and several EU member capitals. These tense Brexit negotiations have been a dark cloud hanging over the EU-UK relationship. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, support for Ukraine rallied Europe's leaders, strengthening UK-France relations in particular. A return to normal communication as leaders coordinated aid packages seemed to prevail. Now, as elections rock both sides of the Atlantic and aid for Ukraine has slowed, the UK and EU must put aside past grievances to focus on the future, shared challenges facing Euro-Atlantic security, and their continued support of Ukraine. In an op-ed published in Le Monde, Starmer outlined the urgency of greater France-UK relations to address the numerous challenges facing Europe and European security.

Much attention has been paid to Prime Minister Starmer’s views towards the future of EU-UK relations. On the campaign trail, he made it clear he will not seek to have the UK rejoin the EU nor the single market. Instead, he has put forward his government would seek to remove trade barriers and deepen EU-UK security cooperation. Towards that goal, Starmer rallied leaders at the summit to crack down on Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers skirting international sanctions. David Lammy, the new Foreign Minister, claimed a Labour government would seek “a new geopolitical partnership with the EU” and is pursuing talks over an EU-UK security pact. John Healey, Labour’s new Defense Secretary, has been on the road since assuming the role, including a visit to Ukraine where he announced a major new military support package.

The recent transition to a Labour-led government in the UK marks a significant turning point for EU-UK relations, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer poised to redefine ties with both Brussels and individual EU member states.

The European Political Community (EPC) serves as a new forum for discussing security and shared interests among European leaders, but it faces skepticism regarding its effectiveness in delivering tangible outcomes.

European Political Community Summit: What a New Labour Government Means for EU-UK Relations - Wilson Center,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxQVWdDX1d4Y1VJb3pyVnZ0UjJZRUFKaEVfa1M0emp5U1p0UDQ4SlB3WC1Fc0V3b1VZZ2o1a3Vfa2lKd2U1M3pvVURvQ0sxeXFjRXphSzh0cXdXajFITGcwWS01MFpIanFWSzUzY21MV2ZPaWdzc2NyTjZmVjg5LVcwbXpEQVZnMTd0MWNqbWNaX19xb0o4WlpMWFF2ZTJlR3UycnZjZzBmOFViTW5yakw4WTFsZjBoYWtzZm8tR09R?oc=5,Wilson Center,2024-07-29,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/european-political-community-summit-what-new-labour-government-means-eu-uk-relations,"The fourth European Political Community (EPC) summit met on July 18 at a precipitous moment for EU-UK relations. Fourteen years of Conservative-led governments came to an end after the July 4 general election, with the new Labour government ushering in a new era for redefining relations with both Brussels and specific EU member states. This EPC summit offered a unique lens into the current state of EU-UK relations, which – post-Brexit – now has a chance to build back better relations under a new Labour-led UK government.

The EPC was initially proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has been lauded as a new forum for discussing security and shared interests with a wide range of European leaders, both within and outside of the EU, while simultaneously being lambasted as a talkshop that fails to deliver meaningful progress. The previous summit in Granada, Spain was widely dismissed as a disappointment, in part due to heightened tensions between participating states–Armenia and Azerbaijan as well as Kosovo and Serbia–dashing any hopes for productive dialogue. Ahead of the last EPC summit it was also being proposed as an outer ring of EU gradual integration–not necessarily charting a path to membership but as a means of the EU exerting influence in its neighborhood. Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made headlines in Granada after insisting that the entire summit’s agenda be scrapped to focus solely on migration.

How the US Elections Could Shake Up the Western Balkans - German Council on Foreign Relations | DGAP,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOWHhhbEUzaUlyQVl0dHFWNUdRZUJ2dm1Na3FYbHFFNExDSEFRX2dwWHQ1ZktmMUNLekRjdGdoZm5DaVoydGhWRjktSm9SNmV1bFZSTTJvUV9NLUp3UnVjbzRYREtMLWJxY3ZJbE9iSzFWYmpEY04tQ2FUZ1UxWGZQVFVCUHhnMEcwYm5CcTBoaw?oc=5,German Council on Foreign Relations | DGAP,2024-09-03,https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/how-us-elections-could-shake-western-balkans,"Situation

The engagement of the United States and its close cooperation with European partners have been major factors in providing regional stability in the Western Balkans ever since the 1990s. America’s legacy there includes a series of peace settlements reached after the wars in the former Yugoslavia that are guarded by NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo and the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Currently, three out of the six countries in the region – Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia – are NATO members. Two others – Bosnia and Kosovo – are at various stages of joining the alliance. Serbia, the largest country in the region, remains ­formally neutral while it maintains a working partnership with NATO and relies on KFOR for the protection of ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo.

The Western Balkans are now at a pivotal moment thanks to a combination of two factors: Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and gradual US disengagement from Europe’s peripheries. These factors have also made the outcome of this US presidential election – with its starkly different consequences for Europe – a turning point for the region. This election comes at a time when local political elites have learned to translate increased geopolitical rivalries between Western and non-Western powers to their own advantages. Most prominently, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has expanded bilateral relations with China and Russia while simultaneously managing to continue with Serbia’s EU accession path despite non-alignment with its sanctions on Russia. Vučić has also kept the United States on his side by providing key military support to Ukraine.

In recent years, US diplomacy in the region has become less active and taken a gradual “realist turn.” These developments resulted from a preference for regional stability and broader strategic objectives that often took priority over liberal transformation. Since Russia’s war against Ukraine started, the reflex of the United States toward reliance on strong leaders (“stabilitocracy”) has become even more entrenched. The war also caused the EU to revive its enlargement project to save Ukraine, bringing new impetus to a stalled accession process with the Western Balkan countries.

Meanwhile, except for in the security domain, Washington has largely accepted that the political responsibility for the Western Balkans rests with the EU, with whom the countries in this region bind their futures. Given their geographical location, the states of the Western Balkans are also much more important to the EU in terms of security, stability, trade, and transit or migration routes than they are to the United States.

This combination results in a lack of European leadership and resources to deal with the region’s unresolved conflicts. The challenges for the Western Balkans will become even more daunting in the context of the shifting US role there, which is especially dependent on the strategic approach and Balkan policy of the new American president and his or her administration.

The engagement of the United States and its close cooperation with European partners have been major factors in providing regional stability in the Western Balkans ever since the 1990s. America’s legacy there includes a series of peace settlements reached after the wars in the former Yugoslavia that are guarded by NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo and the European Union Force (EUFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Currently, three out of the six countries in the region – Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia – are NATO members. Two others – Bosnia and Kosovo – are at various stages of joining the alliance. Serbia, the largest country in the region, remains ­formally neutral while it maintains a working partnership with NATO and relies on KFOR for the protection of ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo.

The Western Balkans are now at a pivotal moment thanks to a combination of two factors: Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and gradual US disengagement from Europe’s peripheries. These factors have also made the outcome of this US presidential election – with its starkly different consequences for Europe – a turning point for the region. This election comes at a time when local political elites have learned to translate increased geopolitical rivalries between Western and non-Western powers to their own advantages. Most prominently, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has expanded bilateral relations with China and Russia while simultaneously managing to continue with Serbia’s EU accession path despite non-alignment with its sanctions on Russia. Vučić has also kept the United States on his side by providing key military support to Ukraine.

In recent years, US diplomacy in the region has become less active and taken a gradual “realist turn.” These developments resulted from a preference for regional stability and broader strategic objectives that often took priority over liberal transformation. Since Russia’s war against Ukraine started, the reflex of the United States toward reliance on strong leaders (“stabilitocracy”) has become even more entrenched. The war also caused the EU to revive its enlargement project to save Ukraine, bringing new impetus to a stalled accession process with the Western Balkan countries.

Meanwhile, except for in the security domain, Washington has largely accepted that the political responsibility for the Western Balkans rests with the EU, with whom the countries in this region bind their futures. Given their geographical location, the states of the Western Balkans are also much more important to the EU in terms of security, stability, trade, and transit or migration routes than they are to the United States. However, Germany and France are now politically weakened and simultaneously distracted by domestic issues, and the EU institutions are preoccupied with the start of a new political cycle in Brussels. This combination results in a lack of European leadership and resources to deal with the region’s unresolved conflicts. The challenges for the Western Balkans will become even more daunting in the context of the shifting US role there, which is especially dependent on the strategic approach and Balkan policy of the new American president and his or her administration.

The head of Serbian diplomacy explained that the document will facilitate green transition in Serbia and improve access to clean energy, which is in line with Serbia’s European aspirations.

He noted that the agreement also sends a strong message about Serbia's commitment to improving overall relations with the United States and that we are one step closer to a strategic partnership and strategic, good, long-term relations with the United States.

I believe that this is responsible and state-building behaviour and that both Serbian and American energy companies, but above all citizens of Serbia, will benefit from this agreement, which will result in a more reliable, safer and long-term stable supply in circumstances in which our industry and economy are developing day by day, Đurić said.

He pointed out that this agreement also sends a strong message about Serbia’s commitment to improving overall relations with the United States and that we are one step closer to a strategic partnership and strategic, good, long-term relations with the United States.

“I believe that this is responsible and state-building behaviour and that both Serbian and American energy companies, but above all the citizens of Serbia, will benefit from this agreement, which will result in a more reliable, safer and long-term stable supply in the conditions in which our industry and economy they are developing day by day”, Đurić said.

Fernandez assessed that the signing of this agreement will raise Serbian-US cooperation to a higher level, adding that the United States is satisfied with the fact that cooperation with Serbia in the field of clean energy will continue.

ROBINSON: Good afternoon. Welcome to today’s Council on Foreign Relations meeting with President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu of Kosovo.

My name is Linda Robinson. I’m the Women and Foreign Policy senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and I’ll be presiding over today’s session.

I would like to welcome you, Madam President, to the Council on Foreign Relations. We welcome this opportunity to have a dialogue about Kosovo’s foreign policy, regional security challenges, and U.S. relations.

It has been sixteen years since Kosovo’s independence, and twenty-five years since the NATO invention to stop the Kosovo War waged by Slobodan Milošević, which cost 13,000 lives and displaced one million residents. Many of our attendees here may know that some seven hundred American servicemen and women have been deployed to Kosovo in the NATO peacekeeping force, which the U.S. has been supporting since 1999.

I had the opportunity to visit you in April, and see the vibrant democracy that Kosovo has become, and talk about your twenty-year role in politics and government. Everyone here has the bio for President Osmani, but I just would like to take a moment and note a few of the highlights.

She was the chief of staff to the first president, Sejdiu. She helped draft the constitution. She has been elected five times to the parliament, and she was the first woman speaker of parliament. And she is the second woman president of Kosovo in just sixteen years of its history. So that’s really an astonishing contribution and journey that you’ve been on with your country.

I would like to jump right into the future, into the moment we are in right now, and ask you to talk about the causes of the current tensions that Kosovo is experiencing, and what you think are the critical steps needed by Kosovo and others to move ahead.

OSMANI: Well, thank you so much, Linda, for the kind introduction, and thank you all for joining. It’s a really great honor and privilege to be able to speak here today, and to have a conversation with you and everyone present on how we see the future of Kosovo, and also the future of our region as part of the European family of nations.

The Republic of Kosovo truly is a testament to what democracies can achieve when they stand together in defense of values: the values of freedom, independence, and democracy. For centuries, the people of Kosovo lived under occupation. For decades we lived under an apartheid-like regime that escalated into a genocidal war against our people.

Even today, twenty-five years after the war, you see a lot of wounds, a lot of pain among the people of Kosovo because you can’t find one single family that hasn’t gone through hell. You rightly pointed out that the vast majority of the people of Kosovo were displaced as IDPs or refugees. I was initially an IDP and then became a refugee myself, and that shapes you for the rest of your life. But at the same time, what you see among the people of Kosovo is the kind of resilience that is unmatched, but at the same time, gratefulness for those allies and partners that stood by us during the darkest hours of our history, and just this spirit of moving forward and making steps forward towards the Euro-Atlantic family of nations, which is where we belong.

Now despite of this very, very painful past, and practically rising from the ashes of war, the people of Kosovo have shown such a strong determination to make sure that the country moves towards the European Union and NATO, and just the system of values that we belong to and for which we fought and sacrificed so much.

Now in the past three-and-a-half years that I’ve been president and with the current government, we’ve focused so much on rule of law because we believe that enforcing rule of law, where all the citizens are equal before the law is so fundamental to every other success that we can achieve, whether it’s economy, or just how that reflects in foreign relations, and also development in other areas. And that has in turn—of course has had a positive effect with the country—with Kosovo becoming a country with the highest GDP growth in the region in the past couple of years, and also with quite a big prospect on so many—on so many areas. Kosovo right now is the strongest democracy in the region and, as I said, a champion when it comes to our rule of law reforms.

But focusing on rule of law meant, at the same time—rightly so—focusing on fighting mafia gangs, and we’ve been very effective at it. Of course these gangs that were situated in the north of Kosovo, they are led by criminals like Radoicic and his friends that were serving Aleksandar Vučić, the president of Serbia, are also at the blacklist of the United States, and the United Kingdom, and other countries. But they were mostly focused o","(1) [Kosovo]  
President Vjosa Osmani emphasized Kosovo's resilience and commitment to democratic values despite a painful history, highlighting the nation's journey from war to striving for integration into European and NATO frameworks. She articulated a vision for Kosovo as a vibrant democracy that has made significant progress over the last 25 years, demonstrating strong determination to align with Euro-Atlantic values. #  

(2) [U.S. Relations]  
Osmani discussed the critical role of the United States in Kosovo's history, particularly its support during the NATO intervention, which is a cornerstone of Kosovo's security and foreign policy. She expressed gratitude for the ongoing partnership with the U.S., which remains vital for Kosovo's aspirations towards European integration and stability in the region. #  

(3) [Rule of Law]  
During her presidency, Osmani has prioritized the enforcement of rule of law as essential for Kosovo's development and international relations. She noted that effective governance and legal equality underpin Kosovo's economic growth and have positioned it as a leading democracy in the Balkans, despite ongoing challenges. #  

(4) [Regional Stability]  
Osmani addressed the ongoing security challenges in the region, particularly the influence of organized crime linked to Serbia. She identified the need for collaborative efforts among international partners to combat these threats, emphasizing that the fight against corruption and criminal networks is crucial for maintaining peace and stability in Kosovo and its neighbors. #  

(5) [Serbia]  
The relationship with Serbia remains complex, with Osmani highlighting the negative impact of criminal elements supported by Serbian leadership on Kosovo's stability. She pointed out that addressing these challenges is integral not only for Kosovo but also for regional security and the broader Euro-Atlantic community. #",Kosovo,"President Vjosa Osmani emphasized Kosovo's resilience and commitment to democratic values despite a painful history, highlighting the nation's journey from war to striving for integration into European and NATO frameworks.

ROBINSON: Good afternoon. Welcome to today’s Council on Foreign Relations meeting with President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu of Kosovo.

My name is Linda Robinson. I’m the Women and Foreign Policy senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and I’ll be presiding over today’s session.

I would like to welcome you, Madam President, to the Council on Foreign Relations. We welcome this opportunity to have a dialogue about Kosovo’s foreign policy, regional security challenges, and U.S. relations.

It has been sixteen years since Kosovo’s independence, and twenty-five years since the NATO invention to stop the Kosovo War waged by Slobodan Milošević, which cost 13,000 lives and displaced one million residents. Many of our attendees here may know that some seven hundred American servicemen and women have been deployed to Kosovo in the NATO peacekeeping force, which the U.S. has been supporting since 1999.

I had the opportunity to visit you in April, and see the vibrant democracy that Kosovo has become, and talk about your twenty-year role in politics and government. Everyone here has the bio for President Osmani, but I just would like to take a moment and note a few of the highlights.

She was the chief of staff to the first president, Sejdiu. She helped draft the constitution. She has been elected five times to the parliament, and she was the first woman speaker of parliament. And she is the second woman president of Kosovo in just sixteen years of its history. So that’s really an astonishing contribution and journey that you’ve been on with your country.

I would like to jump right into the future, into the moment we are in right now, and ask you to talk about the causes of the current tensions that Kosovo is experiencing, and what you think are the critical steps needed by Kosovo and others to move ahead.

OSMANI: Well, thank you so much, Linda, for the kind introduction, and thank you all for joining. It’s a really great honor and privilege to be able to speak here today, and to have a conversation with you and everyone present on how we see the future of Kosovo, and also the future of our region as part of the European family of nations.

The Republic of Kosovo truly is a testament to what democracies can achieve when they stand together in defense of values: the values of freedom, independence, and democracy. For centuries, the people of Kosovo lived under occupation. For decades we lived under an apartheid-like regime that escalated into a genocidal war against our people.

Even today, twenty-five years after the war, you see a lot of wounds, a lot of pain among the people of Kosovo because you can’t find one single family that hasn’t gone through hell. You rightly pointed out that the vast majority of the people of Kosovo were displaced as IDPs or refugees. I was initially an IDP and then became a refugee myself, and that shapes you for the rest of your life. But at the same time, what you see among the people of Kosovo is the kind of resilience that is unmatched, but at the same time, gratefulness for those allies and partners that stood by us during the darkest hours of our history, and just this spirit of moving forward and making steps forward towards the Euro-Atlantic family of nations, which is where we belong.

Now despite of this very, very painful past, and practically rising from the ashes of war, the people of Kosovo have shown such a strong determination to make sure that the country moves towards the European Union and NATO, and just the system of values that we belong to and for which we fought and sacrificed so much.

Now in the past three-and-a-half years that I’ve been president and with the current government, we’ve focused so much on rule of law because we believe that enforcing rule of law, where all the citizens are equal before the law is so fundamental to every other success that we can achieve, whether it’s economy, or just how that reflects in foreign relations, and also development in other areas. And that has in turn—of course has had a positive effect with the country—with Kosovo becoming a country with the highest GDP growth in the region in the past couple of years, and also with quite a big prospect on so many—on so many areas. Kosovo right now is the strongest democracy in the region and, as I said, a champion when it comes to our rule of law reforms.

But focusing on rule of law meant, at the same time—rightly so—focusing on fighting mafia gangs, and we’ve been very effective at it. Of course these gangs that were situated in the north of Kosovo, they are led by criminals like Radoicic and his friends that were serving Aleksandar Vučić, the president of Serbia, are also at the blacklist of the United States, and the United Kingdom, and other countries. But they were mostly focused o","(1) [Kosovo]  
President Vjosa Osmani emphasized Kosovo's resilience and commitment to democratic values despite a painful history, highlighting the nation's journey from war to striving for integration into European and NATO frameworks. She articulated a vision for Kosovo as a vibrant democracy that has made significant progress over the last 25 years, demonstrating strong determination to align with Euro-Atlantic values. #  

(2) [U.S. Relations]  
Osmani discussed the critical role of the United States in Kosovo's history, particularly its support during the NATO intervention, which is a cornerstone of Kosovo's security and foreign policy. She expressed gratitude for the ongoing partnership with the U.S., which remains vital for Kosovo's aspirations towards European integration and stability in the region. #  

(3) [Rule of Law]  
During her presidency, Osmani has prioritized the enforcement of rule of law as essential for Kosovo's development and international relations. She noted that effective governance and legal equality underpin Kosovo's economic growth and have positioned it as a leading democracy in the Balkans, despite ongoing challenges. #  

(4) [Regional Stability]  
Osmani addressed the ongoing security challenges in the region, particularly the influence of organized crime linked to Serbia. She identified the need for collaborative efforts among international partners to combat these threats, emphasizing that the fight against corruption and criminal networks is crucial for maintaining peace and stability in Kosovo and its neighbors. #  

(5) [Serbia]  
The relationship with Serbia remains complex, with Osmani highlighting the negative impact of criminal elements supported by Serbian leadership on Kosovo's stability.

Just 10 days before Donald Trump's inauguration, US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma will arrive in Serbia this weekend with the goal of initiating a strategic dialogue between Serbia and the United States, and raising bilateral relations to a higher level.

'A reliable partner and ally'

""When the US establishes a strategic dialogue with a country, it means that it sees that country as a reliable partner and ally,"" says Vuk Velebit of the Pupin Initiative, a Belgrade-based NGO working to strengthen Serbia-US relations.

""Serbia has had strategic agreements with China, Russia and, of course, a special relationship with the EU,"" Velebit told DW. ""The fourth pillar of [Serbia's] foreign policy is the US, and by signing this strategic dialogue, Serbia will achieve this with Washington, which means that relations with China and Russia, along with their influence, will be balanced by a special relationship with America,"" he added.

Closer cooperation despite sanctions?

This strategic cooperation would, according to reports in Serbian media, primarily focus on areas such as the economy, energy and security.

However, it comes at a time when the US has imposed sanctions on Serbia's oil company NIS, of which the state-owned Russian company Gazprom Neft is the majority shareholder. These sanctions are part of a wider set of US measures targeting Russia's energy sector.

""They demand from us a complete exit of Russians from NIS: remove, not reduce,"" Vucic said on January 10, adding that the deadline for the Balkan country to reach an agreement with the Russians could be extended to March 12 at the latest.

For Vuk Velebit, this is a chance for Serbia to push for a change in NIS ownership. ""I think that Serbia wants to correct the harmful sale of NIS, which was sold below any market price, making us completely dependent on Russia in the energy sector,"" he told DW.

""It's not good to be dependent on any single partner, and for Serbia, it is crucial not only to regain control over the sector but also to diversify its energy portfolio. US and American companies could be a reliable partner in this.""

High hopes in the new administration

The euphoria surrounding Trump's return to the White House is most striking in Serbia's pro-government tabloids, which are predicting a grand dismantling of globalism.

President Vucic himself shares this view and is confident that Donald Trump — whom he has called the ""leader of the era"" — will deliver.

""Donald Trump is preparing 200 acts, which he will sign and issue on the first or second day of his presidency. When he does, the entire system of the false liberal world will collapse,"" said Vucic.

Impact on Serbia–Kosovo relations?

However, beyond the prospect of a ""fight against globalists,"" which delights Serbian officials, the return of the Republicans raises hopes in Belgrade that the US might become more favorable to Serbia in the Kosovo dialogue process too.

Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, believes that those hopes are to a certain degree realistic.

""Serbia's government certainly does not believe that the Trump administration will change its stance on Kosovo, but they do believe that on issues such as the economic position of Serbs in northern Kosovo and the protection of monuments and religious sites in Kosovo, they might get a better deal with the Trump administration,"" explains Vuksanovic.

Despite the optimism surrounding U.S.-Serbia relations, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on Serbia's oil and gas company NIS, largely owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft.

Serbian officials see this as an opportunity to regain control over NIS and diversify energy partnerships, potentially with American companies. #

There is a prevailing belief among Serbian officials that the Trump administration may adopt a more favorable stance regarding Serbia's concerns in the Kosovo dialogue process. While acknowledging that the fundamental U.S. position on Kosovo may not change, Serbian leaders hope for improved discussions on economic conditions and the protection of Serbian heritage in northern Kosovo.

This strategic cooperation would, according to reports in Serbian media, primarily focus on areas such as the economy, energy and security.

However, it comes at a time when the US has imposed sanctions on Serbia's oil company NIS, of which the state-owned Russian company Gazprom Neft is the majority shareholder. These sanctions are part of a wider set of US measures targeting Russia's energy sector.

""They demand from us a complete exit of Russians from NIS: remove, not reduce,"" Vucic said on January 10, adding that the deadline for the Balkan country to reach an agreement with the Russians could be extended to March 12 at the latest.

For Vuk Velebit, this is a chance for Serbia to push for a change in NIS ownership. ""I think that Serbia wants to correct the harmful sale of NIS, which was sold below any market price, making us completely dependent on Russia in the energy sector,"" he told DW.

""It's not good to be dependent on any single partner, and for Serbia, it is crucial not only to regain control over the sector but also to diversify its energy portfolio. US and American companies could be a reliable partner in this.""

High hopes in the new administration

The euphoria surrounding Trump's return to the White House is most striking in Serbia's pro-government tabloids, which are predicting a grand dismantling of globalism.

President Vucic himself shares this view and is confident that Donald Trump — whom he has called the ""leader of the era"" — will deliver.

""Donald Trump is preparing 200 acts, which he will sign and issue on the first or second day of his presidency. When he does, the entire system of the false liberal world will collapse,"" said Vucic.

Impact on Serbia–Kosovo relations?

However, beyond the prospect of a ""fight against globalists,"" which delights Serbian officials, the return of the Republicans raises hopes in Belgrade that the US might become more favorable to Serbia in the Kosovo dialogue process too.

Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, believes that those hopes are to a certain degree realistic.

""Serbia's government certainly does not believe that the Trump administration will change its stance on Kosovo, but they do believe that on issues such as the economic position of Serbs in northern Kosovo and the protection of monuments and religious sites in Kosovo, they might get a better deal with the Trump administration,"" explains Vuksanovic.

How justified are these expectations?

""New era in Serbia —US relations!"" ran the headline in a Serbian tabloid following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election in November. It was a sentiment echoed by other Serbian newspapers.

Soon after, President Aleksandar Vucic said that, during his phone call with the president-elect, he emphasized that support for Trump had been greater in Serbia than anywhere else in Europe.

""I am confident that we will make — he will make — America great again, and that we will make Serbia a proper country, one that will be able to cooperate very well with the United States,"" Vucic said at the time.

Just 10 days before Donald Trump's inauguration, US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma will arrive in Serbia this weekend with the goal of initiating a strategic dialogue between Serbia and the United States, and raising bilateral relations to a higher level.

'A reliable partner and ally'

""When the US establishes a strategic dialogue with a country, it means that it sees that country as a reliable partner and ally,"" says Vuk Velebit of the Pupin Initiative, a Belgrade-based NGO working to strengthen Serbia-US relations.

""Serbia has had strategic agreements with China, Russia and, of course, a special relationship with the EU,"" Velebit told DW.

The meeting will be another step in the UK’s bid to reset ties with the union—a theme that has dominated the British leadership’s foreign policy discourse since the Labour Party’s general election victory on July 4, 2024.

While standing firm that the UK will not rejoin the EU or its single market, the country’s top officials have been sending a clear message: London is ready to wipe the slate clean and build a new relationship with the bloc. Regular structured dialogues on security and trade issues, an EU-UK leaders’ summit, and a wide-ranging defense and security pact are among the proposals that Labour has put on the table.

Despite the challenges, concluding a full-fledged agreement on foreign, security, and defense policy should be a priority for both London and Brussels. With fewer like-minded allies than they once had, the EU and the UK need each other to navigate today’s turbulent geopolitical waters. As neighbors with deep-rooted ties and largely aligned worldviews and values, they are well placed to tackle common challenges together. While achieving a foreign policy pact will take time and patience on both sides, London and Brussels cannot afford to squander this opportunity­.

A Difficult but Necessary Task

Establishing a foreign policy partnership with the EU promises to be an uphill struggle for the UK. During the turbulent Brexit negotiations, former prime minister Boris Johnson’s government, eager to pursue its ambition of a “Global Britain,” rejected the idea of formal foreign policy cooperation with Brussels. As a result, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) that, together with the Brexit withdrawal agreement, governs EU-UK relations omits foreign policy and security issues, except for provisions on cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and weapons of mass destruction.

It was not until Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022 that relations began to thaw, paving the way for pragmatism and opening new avenues for cooperation, albeit mainly ad hoc. A highlight was the conclusion of the Windsor Framework, which simplified trading arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the EU’s response to the UK’s recent enthusiasm has so far been rather muted. Soon after the Labour government announced its reset plans, Brussels issued the UK with a list of demands. Ostensibly a test of good faith, it is a checklist for the British government to prove its “real commitment” to adhering to the negotiated post-Brexit agreements. The requirements include a less bureaucratic route for certain EU citizens living in the UK to remain in the country and a youth mobility deal. Brussels is also keen for Britain to rejoin the Erasmus student exchange program—something London has been reluctant to do.

Yet, cooperation is warranted by the challenges facing Europe, which are growing in scale and complexity—from the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East to geopolitical competition with China, and from authoritarian tendencies around the world to the deterioration of the rules-based international order.

Donald Trump’s return as U.S. president should be another factor that accelerates EU-UK talks on a security and defense pact. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on imports, skepticism toward assistance for Ukraine, and eagerness to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin have raised alarm bells across Europe. Poised to pursue protectionist America First policies and a transactional approach to international relations, the new administration will hardly be the reliable partner London and Brussels wish to see in Washington.

The Case for Closer Foreign Policy Cooperation

While bad blood from the testy Brexit negotiations may still linger between the UK and the EU, there is much more that unites the two sides than divides them. The security of their citizens, the integrity of their democratic systems, and the survival of the rules-based world order are priorities for leaders on both sides of the English Channel. In the coming years, Russia’s revisionist ambitions, illiberal tendencies in Europe and the world, and Trump’s second presidency will test all three priorities.

Albeit in different ways and for different reasons, both Putin and Trump will seek to exploit divisions between the EU and the UK. Rather than give in to these divide-and-rule tactics, Brussels and London need to recognize what is at stake and take decisive action. They should leverage the positive momentum created by the new British leadership to develop joint strategies in pursuit of common foreign policy goals. Three strategically important geographic theaters stand out: Ukraine, the Western Balkans, and China.

The meeting will be another step in the UK’s bid to reset ties with the union—a theme that has dominated the British leadership’s foreign policy discourse since the Labour Party’s general election victory on July 4, 2024.

While standing firm that the UK will not rejoin the EU or its single market, the country’s top officials have been sending a clear message: London is ready to wipe the slate clean and build a new relationship with the bloc. Regular structured dialogues on security and trade issues, an EU-UK leaders’ summit, and a wide-ranging defense and security pact are among the proposals that Labour has put on the table.

Despite the challenges, concluding a full-fledged agreement on foreign, security, and defense policy should be a priority for both London and Brussels. With fewer like-minded allies than they once had, the EU and the UK need each other to navigate today’s turbulent geopolitical waters. As neighbors with deep-rooted ties and largely aligned worldviews and values, they are well placed to tackle common challenges together. While achieving a foreign policy pact will take time and patience on both sides, London and Brussels cannot afford to squander this opportunity­.

A Difficult but Necessary Task

Establishing a foreign policy partnership with the EU promises to be an uphill struggle for the UK. During the turbulent Brexit negotiations, former prime minister Boris Johnson’s government, eager to pursue its ambition of a “Global Britain,” rejected the idea of formal foreign policy cooperation with Brussels. As a result, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) that, together with the Brexit withdrawal agreement, governs EU-UK relations omits foreign policy and security issues, except for provisions on cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and weapons of mass destruction.

It was not until Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022 that relations began to thaw, paving the way for pragmatism and opening new avenues for cooperation, albeit mainly ad hoc. A highlight was the conclusion of the Windsor Framework, which simplified trading arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the EU’s response to the UK’s recent enthusiasm has so far been rather muted. Soon after the Labour government announced its reset plans, Brussels issued the UK with a list of demands. Ostensibly a test of good faith, it is a checklist for the British government to prove its “real commitment” to adhering to the negotiated post-Brexit agreements. The requirements include a less bureaucratic route for certain EU citizens living in the UK to remain in the country and a youth mobility deal. Brussels is also keen for Britain to rejoin the Erasmus student exchange program—something London has been reluctant to do.

Yet, cooperation is warranted by the challenges facing Europe, which are growing in scale and complexity—from the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East to geopolitical competition with China, and from authoritarian tendencies around the world to the deterioration of the rules-based international order.

Donald Trump’s return as U.S. president should be another factor that accelerates EU-UK talks on a security and defense pact. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on imports, skepticism toward assistance for Ukraine, and eagerness to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin have raised alarm bells across Europe. Poised to pursue protectionist America First policies and a transactional approach to international relations, the new administration will hardly be the reliable partner London and Brussels wish to see in Washington.

The Case for Closer Foreign Policy Cooperation

While bad blood from the testy Brexit negotiations may still linger between the UK and the EU, there is much more that unites the two sides than divides them. The security of their citizens, the integrity of their democratic systems, and the survival of the rules-based world order are priorities for leaders on both sides of the English Channel. In the coming years, Russia’s revisionist ambitions, illiberal tendencies in Europe and the world, and Trump’s second presidency will test all three priorities.

Albeit in different ways and for different reasons, both Putin and Trump will seek to exploit divisions between the EU and the UK. Rather than give in to these divide-and-rule tactics, Brussels and London need to recognize what is at stake and take decisive action. They should leverage the positive momentum created by the new British leadership to develop joint strategies in pursuit of common foreign policy goals. Three strategically important geographic theaters stand out: Ukraine, the Western Balkans, and China.
