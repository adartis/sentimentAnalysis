Unrest on Wednesday broke out in the northern city of Novi Sad when supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party threw flares at anti-government protesters who had been marching past the party offices, according to video from the scene. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said there were gatherings at some 90 locations in the country on Wednesday evening.

At the clashes in Novi Sad, rival groups hurled rock and bottles at each other amid clouds of smoke and chaos. An army security officer at the SNS party offices at one point fired his gun in the air, saying later he felt his life had been in danger.

The incidents marked an escalation in protests led by university students that have rattled Vucic’s increasingly autocratic rule in Serbia, a candidate nation for European Union membership.

Similar clashes were also reported on Tuesday evening.

The EU’s Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said on X that reports of violence are “deeply concerning.”

“Advancing on the EU path requires citizens can express their views freely and journalists can report without intimidation or attacks,” Kos added.

The Serbian president has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms and of allowing organized crime and corruption to flourish. He denies those allegations.

Skirmishes also erupted in the capital Belgrade where riot police used tear gas to disperse groups of protesters. Riot police formed a cordon around a makeshift camp of Vucic’s loyalists outside the presidency building downtown.

Dacic, the interior minister, accused the protesters of attacking governing party loyalists. He said “those who broke the law will be identified and sanctioned.”

University students posted on X to accuse the authorities of trying to “provoke a civil war with the clashes” at demonstrations. The rallies so far passed for the most part without incident even while drawing hundreds of thousands of people.

Occasional violence in the past months mostly involved incidents between protesters and the police, rather than between rival groups.

“Police were guarding the regime loyalists who were throwing rocks and firing flares at the protesters,” a post by the informal group, Students in Blockade, said. The account is run by students from across Serbia who have been protesting the government since late last year.

Demonstrations started in November after a renovated train station canopy crashed in Novi Sad, killing 16 people and triggering accusations of corruption in state-run infrastructure projects. More protests are planned on Thursday evening.

The protesters are demanding that Vucic call an early parliamentary election, which he has refused to do. Serbia is formally seeking EU membership, but Vucic has maintained strong ties with Russia and China."
"While targeting its critics for foreign funding, Serbian state receives billions from abroad - European Western Balkans",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNVkM5bmpBTk9KenhWYWxianZib05DYTBIWjZTdEY4OEVwREh2VkE2LVVaVDJvQ1k3S0kzTUlzV3duUk9WNXZIOTBUZGR4cC1KT2NQbXBTUGJxX2xDdDQ5bmdBa3Y4MmxvTkxTWGFFcUtUZTd3REFYV190RTBPaHVkYWl0ZzJHeUg5VVdoT0JZT2xRbUVhMGJQdTI2Qlh0cThaeGJBcWZXbVN3eG14Y0RFbTlXUXJsZU9YM1ZCSnQxQVZTYW5aLWdSd2NXSmFrVHNRN2c3MQ?oc=5,European Western Balkans,2025-06-06,https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2025/06/06/while-targeting-its-critics-for-foreign-funding-serbian-state-receives-billions-from-abroad/,"The highest Serbian officials, along with pro-government tabloids, continue to spread the narrative that the protests in the country are being financed from abroad with the aim of destabilizing Serbia. Old stories about “colour revolution” are being recycled daily in an attempt to divert divert attention from students and citizens demands, who have been protesting for seven months. Meanwhile, the Serbian state and its institutions remain the largest recipients of foreign funding from governments and the EU.

Over the past decade the EU has allocated approximately 64 million euros to support civil society and media – representing only 2-4% of the EU’s total non-refundable assistance to Serbia, which reached over 2.9 billion during the same period.

“The operation to overthrow Serbia has been in the making fro a long time. There has been long-term investment against our judiciary, prosecution… Enormous sums of money have been funelled into Serbian media that have become a platform for destroying Serbia. Billions of euros were invested in bringing Serbia down, and they nearly succeeded”, President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić said during the SNS rally in Niš.

“Blockaders (the word used by ruling party and tabloids for students) directly linked to London – now everything is clear: Europe is financing the destruction of the state and with those help”, reads one of dozens of articles from the daily tabloid Informer, which routinely targets government critics without consequence.

Informer alleges that foreign governments are financing the protests, claiming that students have met with professor from Faculty of Political Science, Dušan Vučićević, who leads the “Popular Democracy”, project aimed at promoting democratic values among high school students in Serbia. The fact that the project is supported by the Westminster Foundation, publicly disclosed on the project’s website – is used by Informer as “evidence” that British intelligence is behind the protests.

The financing of civil society organizations was also the topic of an Informer morning show featuring former Yugoslav foreign minister Vladislav Jovanović. The show claimed that the West is waging a hybrid war against Serbia and accused independent media outlets and civil society organizations, such as KRIK and Crta, of allegedly hiding their funding sources. It concluded that the prosecution should initiate proceedings against them.

Informer failed to mention that the funding sources of these, and other civil society organizations, are publicly available. Detailed information on projects and donors can be found on their websites.

EU has allocated to civil society and media 2-4 total non-refundable assistance

In their attacks on activists and organizations, pro-government media and officials never mention how much foreign funding the Serbian state itself receives. As the EU Delegation to Serbia stated for European Western Balkans, over the past decade the EU has allocated approximately 64 million euros to support civil society and media – representing only 2-4% of the EU’s total non-refundable assistance to Serbia, which reached over 2.9 billion during the same period.

“The EU provides both financial and technical support to civil society development in Serbia through several instruments, including regional and national grants under the ‘Civil Society and Media’ (CSF) program, as well as the ‘Global Europe for Human Rights and Democracy’ program,” the Delegation stated.

Since 2020, 114 grants have been awarded to 143 civil society organizations in Serbia through three main mechanisms: project (action) grants, operational grants, and financial support to third parties (FSTP).

To support grassroots civic initiatives at the local level, over 700 sub-grants have been awarded to smaller civil society organizations across all 29 districts and 102 out of Serbia’s 174 municipalities.

Civil society organizations in Serbia have addressed a wide range of issues, including media freedom, environmental protection and climate change, youth policy and local youth engagement, human rights, anti-discrimination efforts, democracy, citizen participation in policymaking, social inclusion, Roma issues, healthcare and consumer protection, education and employment, and culture. The Delegation added that since 2020, the European Endowment for Democracy (EED) has awarded 160 sub-grants to 106 media outlets and 54 civil society organizations, with one-third of the initiatives involving youth.

Not only does the Serbian government regularly receive funds from EU member states through European programs, it has also benefited from U.S. assistance in the past.

The United States, primarily through USAID and other agencies, has provided over 1 billion dollars in development aid to Serbia since 2000. The majority of these funds have been directed to the state budget and managed by the ruling political majority through public institutions.

In 2024 alone, Serbia received $40,144,406 fr"

Supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) threw flares and firecrackers at anti-government protesters in Novi Sad on Wednesday evening, prompting police to intervene to end the standoff, a major escalation of nine-month-long protests in Serbia.

The student-led protests in Serbia first started in November after a train station canopy collapsed in Novi Sad, killing 16 people and triggering accusations of corruption in state infrastructure projects.

Protests have since drawn hundreds of thousands of people, shaking President Aleksandar Vucic’s firm grip on power. His supporters have recently started organising counter-demonstrations, fuelling fears of possible violence.

Read moreWhy has the EU kept silent on Serbia’s massive protest movement?

At a news conference late on Wednesday, Vucic, flanked by Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, said 16 police officers and around 60 SNS backers have been injured in Novi Sad. He also accused unidentified foreign powers of orchestrating riots and pledged arrests.

""Persons who violated the law will be apprehended ... Tonight, we have averted a catastrophic scenario planned by someone from abroad,"" he said.

Vucic did not provide evidence to substantiate his allegations.

Footage by private N1 TV showed flares and firecrackers being thrown at protesters in Novi Sad from the direction of the SNS offices. It also showed anti-government protesters, some with bloody faces, saying Vucic's backers used sticks and truncheons to attack them.

Protesters then smashed office windows as riot police were deployed outside to guard the building.

Opposition Move-Change movement said Vucic's loyalists have been responsible for the clashes.

""Attacks on people with pyrotechnic devices violate their right to life and protest,"" it said in a statement.

In the capital city of Belgrade, police in full riot gear blocked anti-government protesters from approaching the area in a park near the parliament building where Vucic's supporters have been camping since March.

Elsewhere in Belgrade, anti-government protesters clashed with police who prevented them from approaching local SNS offices.

The protesters have blamed corruption for the Novi Sad railway roof collapse and have demanded early elections that they hope would remove Vucic and his party from power after 13 years.

Students, opposition, and anti-corruption watchdogs have accused Vucic and his allies of ties to organised crime, violence against rivals and curbing media freedoms, something they deny.

On Wednesday evening, students who are leading the protests called supporters to protest in front of SNS offices in major cities in Serbia, including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Cacak and Nis, after several protesters were injured in clashes with SNS in the town of Vrbas on Tuesday evening.

BELGRADE, Serbia—When Serbian investigative journalist Saša Dragojlo stepped outside his home to document a nearby protest on 23 March, he didn’t expect the attention to turn on him. As tensions flared between citizens and supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Dragojlo began filming. Soon pro-government activists were squaring up to him while the police stood idly by, he says.

Other journalists have suffered more serious attacks. At an SNS rally in Niš on 17 May, SBS radio correspondent Nikola Doderović was detained while reporting. Južne Vesti journalist Tamara Radovanović was also attacked and then removed from the scene by police, who let her attackers continue on.

The Parliament also heard testimony from journalists Dinko Gruhonjic, who says he’s received death threats, and Rijalda Mujezinović, whose father’s car was destroyed by vandals in a village near Prijepolje, in western Serbia. “I felt disturbed because they didn’t do it to me directly here in Belgrade, but they did it to my father. He lives alone and he's unprotected,” she said.

Beyond physical attacks, journalists face increasing government surveillance. An Amnesty International investigation recently found that two journalists from the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) — where Dragojlo also works — were targeted with Pegasus spyware, in the third documented case in two years of Pegasus being used against Serbian civil society.

In Reporters Without Borders’ latest edition of the World Freedom Index, Serbia achieved its lowest score yet, ranking 96th out of 180 countries.

The report said that while Serbia was well regarded in the investigative journalism space, the country is “caught between rampant fake news and propaganda.” Journalists, it added, are vulnerable to “political pressures and crimes committed against them go unpunished.”

President Aleksandar Vučić has consistently disparaged independent media outlets, according to Freedom House — echoing rhetoric employed by many of his right-wing counterparts across Europe.

Against this backdrop, Serbia’s candidate status for EU accession has upset European lawmakers who say the bloc should not be opening its doors to a leader who takes an authoritarian stance on media, the rule of law and the judicial system, all while deepening ties with China and Russia.

Vučić is also under pressure at home. In November, a train station canopy collapsed in Novi Sad, killing 16 people and sparking nationwide anti-corruption protests.

Dragojlo spoke to The Parliament about his experience, the media, the state of democracy in Serbia today — and the role the EU has to play in it all.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What happened to you when you were filming the protest in March?

It was a hectic day in Belgrade. There were a lot of tensions between the people in the city and the SNS activists. A crowd gathered close to where I live, and I heard from someone that there were hooligans present. At one point, there was a conflict between some SNS activists. I started to film it. At that moment the fuss stopped, the two guys saw me and approached me. They were hostile. I said, “I'm a journalist, I work for BIRN,” and one of the guys became even more aggressive. He said, “Oh, you're a journalist?” and started leaning towards me. His companion pushed him away, but the intent was clear. It was all in front of several police officers, but they didn’t even take his ID. The crowd was chanting asking for the police to react.

Reporters Without Borders published a piece saying the noose was tightening around journalists in Serbia. Do you think that's an accurate portrayal?

Yes. Practically every day we have a situation where journalists critical of the government are being attacked or prevented from doing their job by ruling party activists. The police are always there and they never stop them. They just stand there, allegedly trying to “prevent bigger incidents.” The Vučić regime is becoming more and more aggressive and autocratic because he's losing voters. After so many years he's finally losing voters due to the actions of the student movement and the killing of 16 people last year in Novi Sad. So the atmosphere in society has changed.

Could the decline in media freedom be reversed anytime soon? Could an impartial media regulator be installed?

No, I don't think it's possible. The only way that something will change is if the people who are in power right now also change. They are controlling all the public broadcasters and all the private media. National broadcasting is not independent and it's not even mildly critical of the government. Vučić controls public broadcasters. And that is one of the pillars of his rule. He's just simulating reality.

Riot police clash with student-led protesters calling for snap elections in Serbia - Euronews.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQdzZMSlZKalRzNkxiS3huTXhPMVhsVXZ5VHJIMFJxMi01UWVIMGl2MjBkd3NFY3N6YV8yY3JWUnJtT3RvZUNjVC1aQ1RmWWRwOW12SUMwVkVFQzczUDkwTkJWa19qYXZXcXBIVEtGV1hjQTVKMWQzclN5d0tmR0I0UXlnYURGMlk5aVFxZE5RR3AwVHg0RVRseW1pUi1QUkhwbTdRcnN1TkFkUmhHNzFQZ2wzdy1tZWluN244YVltR3pvTV96a1kxTlB3?oc=5,Euronews.com,2025-06-28,https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/28/student-led-anti-government-protest-in-serbia-calls-for-early-parliamentary-election,"ADVERTISEMENT

Riot police clashed with anti-government student-led demonstrators who rallied in the Serbian capital of Belgrade on Saturday to demand early parliamentary elections after nearly eight months of protests.

The students have been a key force in driving anti-corruption protests across the nation following the deadly collapse of a newly renovated train station canopy in the city of Novi Sad in November 2024, which killed 16 people.

Many Serbians blamed the collapse on alleged government corruption and negligence in state infrastructure projects, leading to recurring mass protests.

The huge crowd chanted “We want elections!” as they filled the capital’s central Slavija Square and several blocks around it, with many unable to reach the venue.

Several protesters were handcuffed by police, and an officer was seen injured on the ground during the ongoing street battles. It was unclear whether others were injured.

As the protest formally ended, the demonstrators threw eggs, plastic bottles and other objects at riot police who were preventing the crowd from approaching a downtown park.

Serbian police said 36,000 people were present at the start of the protest Saturday.

An independent monitoring group that records public gatherings said around 140,000 people attended the student-led rally.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) have rejected calls for early elections, accusing protesters of seeking to incite unrest under foreign influence without providing evidence.

Despite the government's demands for the protests to end, the large turnout at Saturday’s rally suggested that public anger persisted.

Hours before the student-led rally, the ruling SNS party bused in scores of its own supporters to Belgrade from other parts of the country, many wearing T-shirts reading: “We won’t give up Serbia.”

They were joining a camp of pro-government protesters in central Belgrade, where they have been staying in tents since mid-March.

Presidential and parliamentary elections in Serbia are scheduled for 2027.

Although Vučić and the SNS-led government have repeatedly stated that they want Serbia to join the European Union, Belgrade still maintains good relations with Russia and China."
Protesters Demand Snap Elections in Serbia Despite Ruling Party Wins - Hungarian Conservative,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxPR1FWd3ZKMXJURDJyUkpjRUpwRklHOWswY1VoNFM4amlqYkZoWldwUEotTGpnZ3poSGdxRHlwejNFM0hCZXl3X2ZLQno1UFdlNm5ydXNLd29FN1ZES1N0elJIWERSZkxhSUY1N3JuM3FCc2FWRVdHbllzS1NyaEhWdm9pc1FfcmV6ZVVBaFU2bERaUEVyQTZoZFRSMHNueTQ3MFpKM2R1Y1AyZTVGWHM4?oc=5,Hungarian Conservative,2025-07-02,https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/current/protests-snap-elections-serbia-sns-electoral-victories/,"During the weekend, masses of people took to the streets of Belgrade demanding snap elections. Protests have been ongoing in Serbia—Hungary’s southern neighbour—since November last year. Protesters, disillusioned with President Aleksandar Vučić’s government, accused Belgrade of growing increasingly authoritarian and corrupt. While this weekend’s march still drew a considerable crowd, with approximately 150,000 people attending, it was smaller in scale than the rally in March, which attracted nearly 300,000 participants. This was despite the protest falling on a symbolic date: 28 June, when the Serbian Orthodox Church commemorates the anniversary of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo—a decisive event in Serbian history that marked a turning point in the nation’s political trajectory.

Authorities claimed that 48 officers were injured as the demonstration turned violent. 77 people were detained by the police while 22 protesters also needed medical help. This weekend’ demonstration was not the first since November that resulted in violence—back in March a session of the Serbian parliament was also disrupted by protestors; in the resulting clashes three people were injured. In response to the protests, President Aleksandar Vučić repeated his claim that the demonstrators are ‘trying to bring down the state.’

Aleksandar Vučić (Serbian Progressive Party, SNS) served as Prime Minister of Serbia from 2014 to 2017 and has been President since 2017. Vučić’s Progressive Party-led coalition currently holds 156 of the 250 seats in the Serbian Parliament. The student-led movement repeated its call this weekend for snap elections—a demand the government has dismissed. ‘Should the stated demands not be met… we expect that the citizens of Serbia will be ready to take all available measures of civil disobedience to protect their basic right to a free and legitimate democratic system,’ the students wrote in an open letter to the government shortly after the rally, which was marked by violence, concluded.

‘Vučić is unlikely to suffer an electoral defeat even if snap elections are held’

As no single individual has emerged as the leader of the demonstrations, and the student-led coordinators are not organized into a political party, Vučić is unlikely to suffer an electoral defeat even if snap elections are held. In two highly anticipated local elections in the towns of Zaječar and Kosjerić earlier in June, the SNS claimed—albeit narrow—victories despite the ongoing wave of protests. The Serbian Progressive Party secured 27 seats in Zaječar (while the opposition won 23) and 14 seats in Kosjerić (with the opposition securing 13).

The first protests in November were triggered by the collapse of a rail station canopy in the city of Novi Sad, which resulted in the death of 16 people. Following the tragedy, the government was accused of negligence and corruption, while both the prime minister and the country’s transport and infrastructure minister were forced to resign.

Once the protests began, Serbian universities quickly emerged as hubs for demonstrators, with educational activities forced to shut down in many faculties due to picket lines. The blockades of university buildings lasted from mid-December until around April 2025, when the government decided to significantly cut professors’ salaries until they made up for the lectures they had failed to deliver. Despite these measures, some students are still unable to access adequate education—while some professors are now organizing online lectures, others distribute only reading materials. The ongoing protests have created a highly uncertain situation for many students—with the end of the academic year approaching, it remains unclear in many cases whether universities will be able to compensate for the lost lectures. Pressure is mounting on prospective students too—as long as it remains uncertain whether current students will graduate, the government has yet to authorize new enrolments.

‘The EU...postponed the disbursement of 111 million EUR in aid due to Serbia to pressure Belgrade to bow to the protests’

Since November President Vučić repeatedly warned of foreign influence with relations to the protests. Brussels have recurrently voiced its support for the protestors, with the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy warning the EU candidate country that ‘Serbia's European future depends on the values it chooses to uphold'. Student organizers cycled from Novi Sad to France and then ran nearly 2000 kilometres from Strasbourg to Brussels to draw the EU’s attention to their cause. In Brussels, the student-protestors were welcomed by MEPs, while the EU also postponed the disbursement of 111 million EUR in aid due to Serbia to pressure Belgrade to bow to the protests.

Reflecting on the EU’s attempt to exert pressure on the Serbian government, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said: ‘Everybody knows what kind of attempts have been made in both Serbia and Hungary"

Thousands of protesters took to the streets across Serbia, smashing windows of the governing party’s headquarters in the northern city of Novi Sad, where the country’s antigovernment revolt started more than nine months ago.

The protesters came out in force for a third night on Thursday, following major clashes earlier in the week that saw dozens detained or injured, demanding that President Aleksandar Vucic call an early election.

In Novi Sad, where a train station canopy collapsed last year, killing 16 people and creating public anger over alleged corruption in infrastructure projects, protesters attacked the offices of the governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), carrying away furniture and documents, and splashing paint on the entrance.

“He is finished,” they shouted, with reference to the president as they demolished the offices. The police and Vucic’s supporters, who have guarded the office in Serbia’s second-largest city for months, were nowhere to be seen.

In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, hundreds of protesters and SNS supporters threw flares and firecrackers at each other on one of the city’s main boulevards. Police fired tear gas at least two locations to disperse the protesters and keep the opposing camps apart.

Similar protests were held in towns across the country.

Vucic told pro-government Informer television that “the state will win” as he announced a crackdown on antigovernment protesters, accusing them of inciting violence and of being “enemies of their own country”.

“I think it is clear they did not want peace and Gandhian protests. There will be more arrests,” he said during the broadcast.

He reiterated earlier claims that the protests have been organised from abroad, offering no evidence.

The previous night, there were gatherings at some 90 locations in the country, according to Interior Minister Ivica Dacic the following day.

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that 47 people were arrested in Wednesday’s clashes, with about 80 civilians and 27 police officers left injured.

The EU’s Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said on X that the reports of violence were “deeply concerning”.

“Advancing on the EU path requires citizens can express their views freely and journalists can report without intimidation or attacks,” Kos said on X.

The Serbian president denies allegations of allowing organised crime and corruption to flourish in the country, which is a candidate for European Union membership."

As its grip on power is slipping, Serbia’s government is resorting to ever more desperate measures against pro-democracy protesters. This week, the police actively protected masked goons that brutally attacked citizens with iron rods, flares, rocks, and truncheons. In some cases, officers even used outright violence themselves instead of protecting their fellow citizens.

Democracy protests flaring up again after summer

This summer, Serbia’s streets seemed to rest: people were on vacation and the protests that have been shaking the country for months slowed down. The ruling party may even have thought the fever had broken. But sooner than expected, the quiet shattered again.

On Tuesday 12 August, a crowd gathered in the north of the country to protest in front of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party’s (SNS) offices in Vrbas. Protesters were met with masked SNS supporters armed with sticks, truncheons, and rocks, who set off flares, attacked protesters with iron rods and smashed glass bottles at their feet.

At least 50 people were injured during the chaos, including 16 police officers. Shockingly, however, the officers’ injuries mostly stemmed from them defending the SNS premises: it was these offices, not the protesters, that the police guarded. Instead of safeguarding the public, they stood like shields around the SNS aggressors, allowing the beatings to continue.

Similar violence across the country

Similar events took place in Bačka Palanka that same evening. When protesters exercised their right to dissent, masked SNS loyalists descended with fists and clubs. Here too, the police formed protective chains not around the bleeding citizens on the pavement, but around the ruling party’s property. The message was unmistakable: the government is intent on crushing the protestors, whether in its official or unofficial capacity. And rather than acting as neutral arbiters, the police actively guard those carrying out assaults.

Aggression also occurred in other locations. In Novi Sad, SNS supporters hurled flares and pyrotechnics from party offices at the crowds below, while riot police moved in – not to stop the assault, but to break up the protests.

Serbians respond with defiance and anger

The next evening, on 13 August, people across the country angrily took to the streets in response, in a collective refusal to be tyrannised. In city after city, riot units again guarded SNS offices while masked party supporters roamed freely, picking fights, injuring demonstrators, and retreating behind police lines when threatened by citizens. Where protesters sought protection from the police, they found batons, tear gas and handcuffs.

In Belgrade’s Vračar municipality, one police officer in full riot gear slapped a woman in the face with brute force. A video of the event spread like wildfire on social media – a jarring symbol of a state that brutalises its own people while guarding those who attack them.

Meanwhile in Novi Sad, groups of men dressed in black, wearing balaclavas and bulletproof vests, emerged from the direction of SNS headquarters, throwing stun grenades, stones, bricks, chairs and glass bottles at protesters. A masked figure from among them lifted a gun above the crowd and fired a shot into the air. Panic rippled through the protesters.

Hours later, it emerged that the gunman was not a random thug but a warrant officer of the Serbian Army, on a ‘routine security assignment’. The officer claimed he fired a ‘warning’ shot to protect a colleague, but offered no explanation as to why the Army was deployed to defend party premises. Footage and eyewitness accounts confirmed that police made no move to protect citizens from these armed groups, instead forming a tight cordon around them as they attacked.

Failing government unable to stop the tide

Images in Serbia were the same across the country this week: police protecting the ruling party, masked men attacking with impunity, the law looking the other way as citizens bleed in the streets. This is the flailing of a government that knows its grip is slipping and that fears the crowds more than it trusts its own mandate.

In that fear lies the seed of change: Serbia’s police may no longer protect citizens, but it cannot stop what has begun. The will of the people is moving forward, through tear gas and batons, through the insults of power and the fists of hired thugs.

Many believe the end is near – not because the streets are quiet, but because they are no longer willing to be silent."

Wearing scarves over their faces and chanting slogans against President Aleksandar Vucic, a group of young men threw flares at his Serbian Progressive Party offices in Valjevo, some 60 miles from the capital Belgrade. They set fire to the party's offices before clashing with riot police in a downtown area.

Police threw multiple rounds of tear gas and charged at the demonstrators who hurled bottles, rocks and flares at them.

Similar clashes also erupted Saturday evening in the northern city of Novi Sad and in Belgrade, with police directing tear gas at protesters while battling the protesters who set garbage containers on fire.

The protesters in Valjevo turned out to the streets to protest what they allege is police brutality.

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said at least one policeman was injured in Valjevo and 18 people have been detained so far.

""There will be more detentions. All those who have broken the law will be arrested,"" Dacic said.

He said that the seat of the Valjevo court, prosecutor's office and the municipal building also have been demolished.

Serbia has been gripped by protests since November, when a train station canopy collapse killed 16 people. Many blamed the tragedy on poor renovation work resulting from widespread corruption in infrastructure projects.

The student-led protests had been largely peaceful for months but turned violent this week. The situation has put pressure on Serbia's increasingly autocratic president Vucic, who has refused the protesters' demand to call an early parliamentary election.

Vucic has accused the protesters of following orders from abroad to ""destroy Serbia,"" and promised a crackdown on the nationwide movement led by university students.

The protest in Valjevo drew several thousand people after a video on social media showed a young man from the town being severely beaten by police who kicked him and bashed him with batons during a protest earlier this week.

The gathering was peaceful until groups of protesters threw flares at the SNS offices which sparked the fire inside.

The incident marks the second such attack on the SNS party offices this week after protesters demolished the party headquarters in the northern city of Novi Sad on Wednesday.

Clashes between the SNS party loyalists and police on one side and anti-government protesters on the other side have erupted every evening since then. Dozens of people have been injured and scores have been detained.

Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, has called for ""calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly""

""Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards,"" he said on X this week.

Serbian police have denied reports of brutality, saying they have been attacked and that dozens of officers have been injured in the rioting.

Serbia is formally seeking EU membership, but Vucic has maintained strong ties with Russia and China. The Serbian president has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms while allowing organized crime and corruption to flourish. He has denied this."

At a news conference late on Wednesday, Vucic, flanked by Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, said 16 police officers and around 60 SNS backers have been injured in Novi Sad. He also accused unidentified foreign powers of orchestrating riots and pledged arrests.
""Persons who violated the law will be apprehended ... Tonight, we have averted a catastrophic scenario planned by someone from abroad,"" he said.
Reuters could not independently verify Vucic's claims.
Footage by private N1 TV showed flares and firecrackers being thrown at protesters in Novi Sad from the direction of the SNS offices. It also showed anti-government protesters, some with bloody faces, saying Vucic's backers used sticks and truncheons to attack them.

Opposition Move-Change movement said Vucic's loyalists have been responsible for the clashes.
""Attacks on people with pyrotechnic devices violate their right to life and protest,"" it said in a statement.
In the capital city of Belgrade, police in full riot gear blocked anti-government protesters from approaching the area in a park near the parliament building where Vucic's supporters have been camping since March.
Elsewhere in Belgrade, anti-government protesters clashed with police who prevented them from approaching local SNS offices.
The protesters have blamed corruption for the Novi Sad railway roof collapse and have demanded early elections that they hope would remove Vucic and his party from power after 13 years.
Students, opposition, and anti-corruption watchdogs have accused Vucic and his allies of ties to organised crime, violence against rivals and curbing media freedoms, something they deny.
On Wednesday evening, students who are leading the protests called supporters to protest in front of SNS offices in major cities in Serbia, including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Cacak and Nis, after several protesters were injured in clashes with SNS in the town of Vrbas on Tuesday evening.

Serbia's students plan major rally after issuing 'ultimatum' - DW,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPTUNEczRfcmJoVmpFY2hHSFFOMnlsZkNfdWl3ZFl0QXY0UTJ3MDZ5WTViMFExV3plUGtTRVR2N1lIOGl6LVBZdXM1ZjRkbFh5MEk1ZHliUjE1VzgwckFzcklKXzdiQkxtWm9oY21oX0ZzUngtWlFGZU1mZ0p0OUlfa2IybFkxYzRTRU9KVEZ6bzVsYUxR0gGUAUFVX3lxTFBKYjQ0ZVlESXBaaEtLWmZiRzZVVXp6czVSQldBTlE3UFJCbDFQa1NVNTlwWEowNVBYRTNfSmFRcTRqSUV0aWdLVGZjVDAwMWJQVEJUTUZSNy1pZGNPRWZGQlJCMjZyb2dEdDY5bkRVMDdmMVY1cVR1N19aVy1zTzZsaUtpb2JxdlJRRHZGSUlHTGN4ZkI?oc=5,DW,2025-06-25,https://www.dw.com/en/serbias-students-plan-major-rally-after-issuing-ultimatum/a-73038449,"Faced with mounting pressure from the authorities, Serbia's students have issued an ""ultimatum"" to the government to call snap elections and are urging citizens to continue the push for change.

As Belgrade's asphalt shimmers in blistering 40-degree sunshine, the city is bracing for heat of a very different kind: Students have scheduled another major protest for Saturday.

All eyes are on the Serbian capital, and both anticipation and uncertainty across the country are rising as students remain tight-lipped about their plans and the exact location and timing of the demonstration.

The protest has the potential to be a turning point because the students have issued what they are calling an ""ultimatum"" to the Serbian government, demanding the announcement by 9 p.m. on June 28 that the government will ask the president to dissolve parliament, paving the way for snap elections.

""Should the stated demands not be met within the given timeframe, we expect that the citizens of Serbia will be ready to take all available measures of civil disobedience to protect their basic right to a free and legitimate democratic system,"" the students wrote in an open letter to the Serbian government.

Significant date for the protest

The upcoming protest comes after eight months of protests, during which students and citizens have demanded political and criminal accountability for the collapse last November of the canopy at the entrance to Novi Sad Railway Station, which killed 16 people.

The day chosen for the protest carries particular weight in Serbia.

Vidovdan is a national and religious holiday that falls on June 28. Deeply rooted in Serbian history and mythology, it has often coincided with decisive events and historical turning points in the country's history such as the 1389 Battle of Kosovo and a number of pivotal political events in the 20th century.

Universities under pressure

In the meantime, the government has increased pressure on universities.

For four months now, university professors have been surviving on one-eighth of their salaries as the government refuses to pay salaries for the period during which classes were halted due to student blockades.

The state insists that the unpaid salaries will only be paid once the missed classes have been made up. Universities are now scrambling to do that even as the blockades continue.

While some have shifted to online lectures, others are distributing reading material and hoping that students will manage on their own.

In institutions where practical skills are an essential part of the course, professors warn that these solutions are educationally and legally unacceptable.

""This is clear to professors pretending to teach, to students who are not participating in such teaching and most of all to the state that forced us into this form of instruction,"" says Jelena Kleut, a professor at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Novi Sad.

""The only fair response is to reject such teaching, and some colleagues have done just that — regardless of the consequences,"" she told DW.

Students bear the brunt

But the heaviest burden is borne by the students themselves. Many are refusing to go along with such forms of tuition, even though the end of the academic year is approaching and no one knows what will happen next.

The students have warned that if snap elections are not called, citizens could take 'all available measures of civil disobedience to protect their basic right to a free and legitimate democratic system' Image: Maxim Konankov/NurPhoto/picture alliance

""If the state begins retaliating against students, we could end up with entire classes repeating the year and losing their student status. I don't think that will happen — the scale would be enormous — but we've seen the government do things we once thought impossible,"" says Kleut.

High school seniors face even greater uncertainty: Instead of preparing for university entrance exams, they are waiting to see what the state will do. The government has yet to authorize universities to enroll new students.

Kleut finds it unacceptable that these students are being used as pawns in the standoff between the government and academia.

""But they have been a very rebellious part of society, too. They blocked their high schools . Perhaps the government simply doesn't like the idea of a whole new rebellious generation appearing on university campuses,"" Kleut adds.

Targeting student allies

Repression in Serbia is spreading — not only targeting protesters, but also anyone who has supported them over the past eight months.

Three teachers at Svetozar Miletic High School in the small town of Srbobran were fired for suspending classes in solidarity with the students. One of them was Slavica Fil"

The roads have been fastidiously cleared of banners and debris. The violence exists now only on social media, and in the collective consciousness. And all the while the government does its best to ignore the chaos — but the people refuse to forget.

Serbia’s protests began back in November 2024, after the concrete canopy of the Novi Sad train station collapsed, killing 16 people. The people were quick to blame the disaster on government corruption and incompetence. The station’s canopy, after all, had recently been renovated by Chinese engineers. And though the authorities insist the project was “up to European standards”, no one believes that, especially when the relevant documents remain classified.

Yet if Novi Sad was the trigger, the longevity of Serbia’s protests imply a deeper and broader malaise. Over the last nine months, they’ve morphed from anger over a single issue to a general movement for change, one encompassing the country’s very civic identity. At the centre of it all is President Aleksandar Vučić, who over the last decade has morphed from a far-Right nationalist to a supposedly pragmatic pro-EU figure. Along the way, he has come to epitomise two things: both the long-standing ambiguity of Serbia’s geopolitical position, and a broader continent-wide slide towards populist autocracy.

In a sense, Vučić’s very person is ambiguous. A man of relentless will and fertile intelligence, he is also famed for his oddly feminine lips (one of his nicknames is “pussy lips”). He has been in power for 12 years, circumventing the constitutional term limit by “doing a Putin” and switching between being president and prime minister. Those on the streets have had enough — and many blame Vučić personally. “He’s been in power for so long now, that for many of the protestors that is like a half of their lives,” says Marija, a young professional who has attended several protests.

Among other things, Marija accuses Vučić of hollowing out state institutions, instead framing national life around his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Just as bad, she adds, is the fallout of the Novi Sad disaster. Apart from those still-unclassified files, she notes that only Serbs have yet been charged for the collapse. “It’s final proof for many not just of the cost of corruption but also the protection of foreign investors.” Other young demonstrators have similar complaints. “We want early elections, the reintroduction of democratic norms, an end of mass corruption,” says Stefan, an IT consultant. “We just want the chance to improve our lives.” Fair enough: with inflation around 5%, the cost of food and utilities rising, life here is getting tougher.

All this helps explain why, close to a year on, the protests are still going strong. As I walked through central Belgrade over the weekend, it was impossible to avoid the anti-government chatter after yet another demonstration. If, however, the anti-Vučić crowds are resolute, so is the government. For eight months, things remained largely peaceful. But then, in June, police arrested hundreds of demonstrators, spurring their comrades to blockade roads. That, in turn, prompted the government to flood the streets with counter-demonstrators. Now, both sides are doubling down. Last week, anti-government protesters set the offices of the SNS on fire during a fifth consecutive night of protests.

The police responded with now-customary brutality in Belgrade and Novi Sad. In the city of Valjevo, they used stun grenades and tear gas on protestors. Dozens have since been injured in clashes, with hundreds more detained. According to one young activist named Milos, by now a veteran protester and talking to UnHerd using a pseudonym, the police are “brutal”, adding that they protect gangs of paid thugs to attack demonstrators. For his part, Vučić has said, with the type of prophylactic language beloved by dictators, that the government will not “remain unresponsive”.

It is, though, under pressure. SNS support has steadily eroded. According to a July poll, 54.8% now support the “student list” — an anti-government coalition, as the name suggests partly composed of the middle classes — compared to the 42.1% sticking to Vučić. But in the rural areas, and among the elderly, government support remains huge. The country is polarised, even as some retired people are now coming out in support of the students, joined by less-educated Serbs tired of seeing their living standards drop. The President’s term ends in 2027, and he’s promised to step down then, hoping to mollify the public. But no one buys this; he’s said it too many times before.

All the while, the protests have brought out an increasingly autocratic strain in the President — and not just on the streets. The government now regularly accuses NGOs of plotting to destabilise the country with foreign funding. Serbian media is also less than free. Several pro-Vučić advertising agencies flood TV "
What's Behind The Eruption Of Violence At Protests In Serbia? - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFA5dXlFNDNjOEhLUGZsdGJ6eDJKdXgtTWp5Z0FIR2cwVEtSWmRFNDVPb0ZXX2ZtVEVHaDl0MDF1eTVMTFFfbEt4LU1zbFN6SzdNYjVGUFNoMm9iX3hUaTZHMEJqQkZqTmU5MmFRVWhkRdIBckFVX3lxTE5SSzNySVI4M0NhRXZNb3dwenRnaVdBSEdHamRWQjVZMFAxN1Q0UVJhOEotOVk1Y0h5dWRrLVF4TW5DZDBJclktTm9NYUt6a3lFX1FJVDVqdUk0S0x4U0dVWndNeWotNHMyQTRGZC1HOVlpZw?oc=5,Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,2025-08-20,https://www.rferl.org/a/serbia-protests-violence/33507346.html,"A wave of protests that began in Serbia in November 2024 has entered a new phase, with demonstrators and police clashing daily since August 12, when violence broke out in the northern cities of Vrbas and Backa Palanka.

Those incidents sparked protests in dozens of Serbian cities, including the capital, Belgrade, as accusations of police brutality spread across the country.

""Four or five of them (policemen) beat me, pushed my head into a concrete [surface],"" physics student Dusan Cvetkovic told RFE/RL's Balkan Service. Cvetkovic was arrested in Belgrade on August 14 during an anti-government protest.

The Serbian Interior Ministry has neither denied nor commented on Cvetkovic's claims, or those of other protesters who accused police of using excessive force.

The protests have been further fueled by a video that appeared on the second day of clashes showing young men detained in Novi Sad kneeling before police officers after being arrested.

The images were initially published by pro-government media. Cvetkovic also said he was taken in an unmarked car to a garage and left with bruises on his face after a beating he received there.

In other incidents, supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) attacked peaceful demonstrators.

Who Is Behind The Demonstrations?

Calls for demonstrations have circulated daily on social media. People are invited to join through social media groups that students have been using to communicate with the public since the beginning of the protests.

Many citizens have responded peacefully, but footage by RFE/RL and other media has also shown masked men throwing stones and pyrotechnics at the police.

Protesters trashed several SNS offices and in Valjevo, 80 kilometers southwest of Belgrade, also damaged the headquarters of the Serbian Radical Party, led by convicted war criminal and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's former mentor, Vojislav Seselj.

The spark for the initial protests in November 2024 was the deadly collapse of a railway station roof in Novi Sad.

The tragedy killed 16 people and shocked the public amid reports that corrupt practices led to shoddy construction at the railway station, a flagship government project led by Chinese businesses.

In the following days, dozens of faculties in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Nis, and other university cities were blocked by protesting students supported by the majority of professors.

These developments sparked a wave of demonstrations not seen since the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic’s regime in 2000.

Initially, demands focused on accountability for the Novi Sad tragedy and sought the prosecution of those who attacked student demonstrators. Six months later, student organizations, until then largely apolitical, called for snap elections.

What Was Vucic's Response?

Some of the students' demands were met. The government released thousands of documents related to the Novi Sad reconstruction. But critics argue the archive was incomplete and failed to clarify key details.

They also said that by delivering thousands of documents Vucic and the government were merely trying to appear transparent while in fact deepening confusion about the station project.

In July, the SNS dismissed four party activists accused of attacking Belgrade drama students at peaceful protests in January.

Vucic, however, has never condemned inflammatory rhetoric from his party's officials or pro-government media, some of which has compared demonstrators to Nazis or Croatian World War II-era fascists, the Ustashe.

What Will Happen Next?

The future of the protests and the overall political situation in Serbia remains uncertain.

The divide between Serbia's ruling elite and its critics is wider than ever. Public anger at corruption and organized crime, highlighted in EU progress reports year after year, has reached unprecedented levels.

For the first time since his party came to power in 2012, Vucic faces genuine social resistance. Yet this resistance is not politically articulated because there is no dominant party among the opposition.

The only unifying force behind the rebellion is the student movement -- a generation of young people who have already lost a year of their studies to protests."

Clashes between rival groups of protesters in Serbia flared again late Thursday, police said, as months of anti-government demonstrations boiled over into street violence this week.

A wave of anti-corruption protests has gripped Serbia since November, when the collapse of the Novi Sad railway station roof killed 16 people, a disaster widely blamed on entrenched corruption.

Anti-graft protesters again gathered in several cities across Serbia late Thursday.

That was mainly in response to a previous attack by governing party supporters on demonstrators Tuesday in the town of Vrbas, about 160 kilometres (100 miles) north of the capital Belgrade.

Large groups of pro-government supporters, most wearing masks, confronted protesters on Wednesday, and the two groups hurled bottles, stones and fireworks at each other.

Police had arrested nearly 50 people across the country on Wednesday, and around 30 riot police were injured.

On Thursday, protesters vandalised the Novi Sad headquarters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and two other SNS offices in the city, RTS television reported, during protests spread across Serbia.

In the capital Belgrade, protestors massed in front of government buildings and the army headquarters, before heading toward nearby SNS offices.

But a heavy riot police deployment kept them from reaching the offices using teargas.

""These are no longer peaceful student protests but people who want to provoke violence... This is an attack on the state,"" Interior Minister Ivica Dacic told a news conference.

At least five police officers were injured on Thursday evening and 14 protesters were arrested, the ministry said.

'Intensifying crackdown'

Frustrated with government inaction, protesters have demanded an investigation into the Novi Sad tragedy and piled pressure on right-wing President Aleksandar Vucic to call early elections.

Over the past nine months, thousands of mostly peaceful, student-led demonstrations have been held, some attracting hundreds of thousands.

But this week's violence marks a significant escalation and indicates the increasing strain on Vucic's populist government, in power for 13 years.

Read moreWhy has the EU kept silent on Serbia’s massive protest movement?

Since June 28, when around 140,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade, the government has responded with an ""intensifying crackdown"" on activists, according to a statement by UN human rights experts released earlier this month.

Protesters and those linked to the movement have faced a ""troubling pattern of repression"" including excessive police force, intimidation and arbitrary arrest, the experts said.

Vucic has remained defiant, repeatedly rejecting calls for early elections and denouncing the demonstrations as part of a foreign plot to overthrow him.

Student protesters have accused the police of protecting pro-government supporters while doing little to stop the attacks on their own gatherings.

""The authorities tried to provoke a civil war last night,"" the students wrote on their official Instagram page.

Vucic, who had visited pro-government encampments overnight Wednesday, denied his supporters had started the violence.

""No one attacked them anywhere,"" he said of the anti-government protesters, speaking at a late-night press conference.

""They went everywhere to attack those who think differently,"" he added.

While the protests have so far led to the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of his cabinet, Vucic remains at the helm of a reshuffled government.

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic accused protesters of attacking police in Novi Sad and Belgrade, and towns of Pancevo and Sabac. At least five police officers were injured, he said.
""Police had to act ... to avert attacks,"" he told a news conference in Belgrade. ""We are urging everyone to leave the streets.""

In a live broadcast, the Belgrade-based N1 TV showed at least five protesters being detained by police.
Vucic pledged more arrests after the protests.
""I think it is clear they did not want peace and Ghandian protests. There will be more arrests,"" he said in a live broadcast by Belgrade-based private Informer TV.
The opposition Party of Freedom and Justice said that Pedja Mitrovic, its parliamentary deputy, was injured during the protests and hospitalised.
""This is the handwriting of this government and Aleksandar Vucic, this is how they see Serbia,"" the party said in a statement.
Similar protests were held in towns across the country.
Earlier on Thursday, Dacic said that 27 police officers and around 80 civilians were injured in Wednesday’s clashes, and 47 people had been detained.
Protesters have blamed corruption for the Novi Sad railway station disaster and are demanding early elections in hopes of ousting Vucic and his party.
Students, opposition groups, and anti-corruption watchdogs have accused Vucic and his allies of ties to organized crime, using violence against political rivals, and suppressing media freedoms—allegations they deny.

Protesters in Novi Sad attacked offices belonging to President Aleksandar Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party.

Police fired tear gas at anti-government protesters Thursday evening in at least two Serbian cities, including the capital Belgrade and the northern city of Novi Sad.

Anti-government protesters attacked the Novi Sad headquarters of the President Aleksandar Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive Party, or SNS, smearning it with red paint and smashing windows.

The police or Vucic's supporters, who have guarded the office for months, where nowhere to be seen, AP news agency reported.

Police in full riot gear later cordoned off several blocks in the center of Novi Sad, Serbia's second biggest city, and used tear gas to disperse the protesters.

In Belgrade, hundreds of protesters and SNS supporters threw flares and firecrackers at each other on one of the city's main boulevards.

Earlier in the evening, anti-government protesters had headed towards SNS offices but were stopped by a heavy riot police deployment.

At least five police officers were injured on Thursday evening and 14 protesters were arrested, Serbia's interior ministry said, according to AFP news agency.

Serbia has seen several days of violence and clashes between the pro- and anti-government supporters.

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that protesters had gathered at some 90 locations across the country on Wednesday evening. Nearly 50 protesters were arrested on Wednesday and around 80 civilians and 30 riot police were injured, he said.

Serbia seen months of student-led protests against corruption

It is the latest escalation of thestudent-led demonstrations against Vucic's government that have gripped Serbia since November 2024. These were initially triggered by the collapse of a railway station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people, and was widely blamed on the country's corruption.

The protesters are now demanding that Vucic call an early election.

Vucic has led the Balkan nation for than a decade as both prime minister and president. Under his leadership, Serbia has become increasingly authoritarian and corruption has flourished. Serbia ranks 105 out of 180 countries on Transparency International's 2024 corruption perception index.

Vucic said on Thursday evening that there ""will be more arrests"" and accused the protesters of inciting violence and of being ""enemies of their own country.""

Serbia cracks down on dissent

The EU's Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said on social media that the reports of violence in Serbia, which is a candidate for EU membership, were ""deeply concerning”.

""Advancing on the EU path requires citizens can express their views freely and journalists can report without intimidation or attacks,"" Kos posted.

A group of UN human rights experts in August noted a ""troubling pattern of repression"" in the government's response to the protests.

""Peaceful demonstrators have reportedly faced intimidation, physical attacks, surveillance, and arrests, often without legal justification,"" the UN's human rights body OHCHR, said.

After nine months of relatively peaceful protests, Serbia's streets are beginning to resemble a state of war, with the offices of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) vandalized. Clashes between demonstrators and police with batons, tear gas, smoke bombs and flares, repeat night after night across the country.

Neda Vrebac, from the citizens' assemblies in Novi Sad, has been on the streets for months. She says people are furious and that the violence on the streets is merely a reaction to the regime's violence.

""We went unarmed against bayonets,"" Vrebac told DW. ""I feel, personally, as do other citizens who regularly attend protests, very upset, insecure, and unsafe, and that is a consequence of living under fascism, with all its manifestations.""

Confusion reigns

Protesters on the street often do not know whether they are clashing with police or SNS paramilitaries. Videos circulate on social media showing groups of young men in masks and carrying sticks rushing at demonstrators. Media reports claim that among the SNS supporters were individuals previously convicted of attempted murder, violent behavior, and even a former football hooligan leader convicted for the 2009 murder of a French football fan.

""The authorities, with the help of party criminals, have declared a street war on citizens. But there is no turning back, things have come to a head. Citizens have realized that with the mafia, there is no room for parliamentary democracy, no negotiations left except about handing over power,"" Radivoje Jovovic from the Free Citizens' Movement told DW.

He believes the violence on the streets is a result of the government's nervousness and inability to resolve the crisis.

""The authorities are the ones who refused to acknowledge the just demands of the protests. SNS didn't believe us when we said 'beware the wrath of a patient man,' and now they have committed crimes that have hastened their own end,"" Jovovic added.

Police brutality

Meanwhile, the police have also started applying violence. Citizens and media have documented numerous instances of police brutality. Belgrade student Nikolina Sindjelic testified that she was ""slapped and had her head slammed against the wall"" by the commander of the Personal and Property Protection Unit, Marko Kricak, who also called her a ""whore.""

""He said he would strip me and rape me in front of everyone, that everyone would watch. I was visibly angry, and he said, 'You should beg me to stop beating you,'"" Nikolina Sindjelic told N1 television.

While batons flashed at night, mass arrests occurred during the day. Several pro-regime media outlets published footage showing young men kneeling against a wall with their hands behind their backs, each guarded by a police officer.

With these images, many were reminded of images from wartime detention camps. Neda Vrebac says she knows that at least three of them were twenty-year-olds arrested by police even though they weren't at the protests. One of them is Vukacin Kurilic, whose family she knows personally.

""They are from my assembly, they support everything but are not active participants in the protests,"" Neda Vrebac told DW. ""He was arrested on his way from a store. He was carrying some bags, and when they approached him, the kid resisted, saying he hadn't done anything. Then they searched him, found his asthma inhaler, thought it was pepper spray, and shoved him into a police van. No prior offenses.""

Vucic promises a 'harsh response'

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has promised a harsh state response, but denies that a state of emergency will be imposed.

""At one point, you will see the full determination of the Serbian state. We will use everything at our disposal to restore order, peace, and law in our country, and we will do it. We will oppose all external pressures, everyone who threatens us, who tells us what is allowed and what is not, and until now we have seen that they managed to bring chaos into our country. But we will win,"" Vucic said.

At a press conference, he accused students and citizens of trying to destroy the state, comparing them to fascists and Nazis, and said it was only a matter of days before someone would be killed.

He is not alone in thinking this.

""I fear for human lives. The lives of us citizens, the innocent, children, activists,"" said Neda Vrebac. She also fears the regime might kill someone from its own ranks to escalate the violence further. ""I think he is ready for anything, because there are huge amounts of money and m"

The student-led demonstrators have accused the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS)’s supporters of hurling flares, fireworks, rocks and glass bottles at them, triggering street skirmishes that ended with riot police driving the anti-government protesters off with tear gas and batons.

Dozens of people have been injured and scores more arrested.

President Alexandar Vučić, who began his political career in the far-right Serbian Radical Party before becoming a proponent of European Union membership, has promised that more arrests will soon follow. Vučić has accused the demonstrations, without evidence, of being plotted from abroad by unidentified foreign powers.

Read moreWhy has the EU kept silent on Serbia’s massive protest movement?

The clashes mark a serious escalation in what has been more than nine months of largely peaceful protests and waves of civil disobedience.

The demonstrations erupted in November following the fatal collapse of a concrete canopy in a recently renovated railway station that killed 16 people in Serbia’s second city of Novi Sad – an accident that protesters, who have taken a blood-red handprint as their symbol, blame on cronyism and graft within Serbia’s government and construction industry.

Since then, a student-led movement of hundreds of thousands of Serbians have held mass demonstrations, occupied university campuses and blockaded the Balkan country’s roads to protest what they describe as rampant government corruption.

FRANCE 24 spoke with University of Belgrade Serbian Politics professor Nebojša Vladisavljević about how the mass protests have changed over the course of a struggle that how now lasted more than nine months.

FRANCE 24: How have the mass demonstrations evolved in recent months, and why have their demands expanded?

In the first few months, the demands of the protesters focused on the legal and political responsibility of those responsible for the deaths of 16 people in Novi Sad – meaning those involved in the renovation of the railway station, but also their political bosses. So the focus was on the judiciary, the prosecution service to initiate legal proceedings against these guys. But obviously that didn't work out, despite massive protests.

These are unprecedented protests in this region, and probably even more broadly in Europe in the last few decades. The country is about 6 million people and you had literally hundreds of thousands of people protesting for months. Only in Belgrade, you had four protests in several months, each larger than a hundred thousand people. And Belgrade is a city of a million and a half. And one of these protests in mid-March was about 300,000 people, which is four to five percent of the population of the country as a whole, so it's massive.

The government and the judiciary essentially ignored their demands for accountability. Even after several months, these proceedings that the prosecutors initiated, they were not confirmed by the courts. That obviously told people that nothing will happen.

That's why demands were shifted to the political stage for early parliamentary elections, because it was obvious that under this government, nothing much would happen when it came to these initial demands.

You had very peaceful protests for eight months. And in late June, there was this fourth protest in Belgrade, which was above 100,000 people, and then the police for the first time actually used massive force against peaceful protesters – and that was after the protest, when people were already dispersing. This is a major escalation because prior to late June, essentially the government and the security forces were sitting out protests – they waited for protests to subside exactly in the same way as they did in previous years, because we had several waves of protests in the last few years.

But this time they actually changed strategy and used massive force and detained hundreds of people, most young people, across the country, which then radicalised protests in the following weeks. Earlier, you would have rallies or marches or short blockades of roads these were commemorative road blockades for 16 minutes, for the 16 people killed in Novi Sad. But now, after the use of force by the police, you had road blockades for hours.

And protesters were avoiding contact with the police – whenever the police w"

With the ruling SNS and the opposition both claiming victory, it is not clear what will happen next.

""Let it echo through the skies — SNS meets its demise!"" chanted citizens on the streets of two Serbian towns, Zajecar and Kosjeric, after polls closed in local elections on Sunday evening.

They were convinced that after 13 years of rule by the governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), change was about to happen.

""May the Serbian people experience freedom the way we are feeling it tonight in Kosjeric,"" declared Slavica Pantovic, the opposition candidate for municipal president.

But then, just a few hours later, the ruling SNS declared victory.

""We managed to win because the people chose the state. You can shout, block the streets, but when we step behind the curtain, we vote for our country — not against it,"" said President Aleksandar Vucic.

First election since Novi Sad

For the past month, all eyes in Serbia have been on Zajecar and Kosjeric.

These were the first elections to be held in Serbia since the collapse last November of the canopy at the entrance to Novi Sad railway station, which killed 16 people.

Voter turnout in the local election in Kosjeric, a town of about 10,000 in western Serbia, broke records Image: Oliver Bunic/AFP

The tragedy, which is widely seen by Serbian citizens as the result of deep-seated corruption, sparked months of protests that have put increasing pressure on populist President Aleksandar Vucic.

'We won't let you steal the votes'

Preliminary results show that the SNS won 27 seats in Zajecar compared to the opposition's 23, and 14 seats to the opposition's 13 in Kosjeric.

But the opposition refuses to acknowledge the outcome, and it is possible that there will be a recount in both towns.

""We won't let you steal the votes. You'll have to explain every bag, every sheet of paper — even the ones you've stolen,"" said Ugljesa Djurickovic of the opposition list Change We Believe In in Zajecar on election night.

The opposition leaders in both towns are backed by students who have already organized post-election protests in Kosjeric to ""defend the will of the people."" The students also announced that they would monitor any recount closely.

""If necessary, we'll call all of Serbia — and there won't be enough room here for everyone. We're defending the electoral will, because Kosjeric is free,"" said student Milica Maksimovic at a protest on Sunday.

NGO claims election irregularities

The monitoring mission of the NGO Center for Research, Transparency and Accountability (CRTA) has claimed that there were serious irregularities in the election.

Indeed, the CRTA's assessment after the polls was unequivocal: ""These elections do not reflect the free will of the citizens.""

According to the CRTA report, problems began during the campaign itself, which the center says was marred by the misuse of public resources and violence.

The elections were watched closely because they were the first to be held in Serbia since the Novi Sad train station tragedy last November Image: Jelena Đukić Pejić/DW

The center also says that there were numerous irregularities on election day itself.

""These include the illegal presence of third parties at polling stations, suspicious gatherings near polling sites, vote-buying, parallel records being kept in and outside polling stations in connection with vote-buying, individuals who were not on the voter list attempting to vote, the photographing of ballots, voting without identification, and threats to and pressure on observers,"" CRTA's program director Rasha Nedeljkov told a press conference.

Tension and unease

Students, citizens and opposition politicians were also active on the ground in Zajecar, claiming that they were ""defending the electoral will.""

They told of ""Bulgarian trains"" (a form of vote-buying to rig elections) and the organized transportation of voters from other areas, parallel voter lists and direct vote-buying.

""In a village called Salac, about 30 kilometers from Zajecar, there were about 1,600 thugs with metal rods. At Josif Pancic Primary School, they were bused in — in large buses, minibuses — they were carrying in and out bags, people filmed it and reported it immediately,"" Maja Djinovic, who had come to Kosjeric from Belgrade to support the opposition, told DW.

The atmosphere in both towns on election day was extremely tense and seemed to be on the verge of confrontation. Citizens reported the presence of unknown individuals they suspected of being thugs.

A large police presence further heightened the tension.

""I was terrified by how much police and gendarmerie there were. Why? There's no violence, no threats — we just want a better future for this town,"" one Zajecar resident told DW.

It was the fourth day of unrest in cities across the Balkan country, including in the capital, Belgrade, where police fired teargas at demonstrators and tried to separate rival groups of protesters.

Dozens of people have been injured in the violent clashes, while hundreds have been detained over the past week, as nine months of largely peaceful anti-corruption and pro-democracy protests have reached boiling point.

On Friday night, Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, said the state was stronger than any protest and praised the police for their conduct during the latest demonstrations. “This is the phase of despair and helplessness, when you have nothing more to offer the citizens except beatings, clubs, and all the rest,” he told the national TV broadcaster RTS.

Serbia’s interior minister, Ivica Dačić, denied that police had used excessive force, instead blaming demonstrators for allegedly attacking the officers.

Videos on social media showed police with shields and batons beating up protesters as flares lit up the streets. The rallies on Friday were held under the slogan: “Let’s show them we are not a punching bag.” Demonstrators reportedly threw rocks and eggs at police, who then charged at them in the wide boulevard in front of the Serbian government headquarters.

The clashes were between riot police, anti-government protesters, and Vučić loyalists. The pro-government demonstrators have been accused of hurling fireworks, rocks and glass bottles at anti-government protesters.

In the northern city of Novi Sad on Thursday night, anti-government protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling Serbian Progressive party, or SNS, chanting “he is finished” as they smashed windows and covered walls with red paint.

The student-led protests began in November last year after the collapse of part of the outdoor roof at Novi Sad railway station killed 16 people. Many blamed the tragedy on entrenched corruption and negligence in state infrastructure projects.

Vigils for the victims swiftly escalated into mass demonstrations, with hundreds of thousands of Serbians demanding an investigation into the tragedy, as well as early elections.

The protests have rocked the Serbian government, causing Miloš Vučević, the prime minister at the time of the Novi Sad disaster, to resign and the end of his cabinet. Yet Vučić remains in power, despite accusations that he has stifled democratic freedoms while allowing corruption to flourish.

Alain Berset, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, wrote on X on Friday that he was “concerned” by the violent protests in Serbia. “I call for calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly.

“The EU underlined the need by all parties to uphold the respect for fundamental rights, including the right to peaceful assembly,” the EU Delegation to Serbia said in a statement after the meeting. The ambassador condemned all acts of violence and hate, and urged political actors to avoid inflammatory rhetoric and the spread of disinformation.

Violent clashes between protesters, riot police and pro-government supporters have escalated over the past week. President Aleksandar Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) have faced criticism for allegedly enabling unrest through tacit support for pro-regime violence and disproportionate policing.

Von Beckerath emphasised that any suspicion of excessive use of force must be properly investigated. He also highlighted the importance of protecting journalists and ensuring that police actions remain proportionate and in line with human rights standards.

Dialogue across the political spectrum remains “the only way forward,” the ambassador said, urging all sides to de-escalate tensions and pursue reforms through democratic channels.

Brnabic, for her part, briefed the EU official on Serbia’s progress in the areas of rule of law and European integration. She said that moving forward with EU accession talks — including opening Cluster 3 of negotiations — was a key priority.

In her remarks, Brnabic said the country had seen “daily attacks against police and public institutions, courts and prosecutor’s offices, torching of party offices — primarily those of SNS but also of other parties — destruction of property, and intimidation of journalists and family members of government officials”.

“These actions are a direct assault on the constitutional order, media freedom, and basic citizen security,” she said. “They cannot be reduced to political disagreement or peaceful protest.”

As Serbia's anti-corruption protests enter their ninth month, they show no sign of abating – and are instead changing in their leadership, composition and tactics. At the climax of last weekend's 140,000-strong protest in Belgrade's Slavija Square the students who led the protests since November declared that they would no longer spearhead the rallies. They had set a deadline of Saturday for the government to call for fresh elections. When that was not met, they invited other groups to take on the protest mantle - and called for a campaign of ""civil disobedience"" from anyone opposed to the leadership of President Aleksandar Vucic and his long-governing Progressive Party (SNS). Since then roadblocks have been popping up in cities across Serbia this week and people have been deploying dustbins, chairs and other improvised barriers to block junctions in major cities including Belgrade, Novi Sad and Nis. Local residents' associations - known as ""citizens' assemblies"" - have been heavily involved. As soon as the police dismantle one blockade, another one pops up somewhere else.

Police crackdown triggers backlash

In recent days there have been dozens of arrests – along with complaints of excessive police force. A number of students were treated in hospital – one with a broken collarbone – after Gendarmerie members entered Belgrade University's Law Faculty on Wednesday. Officers also arrested high school students, triggering a protest by parents in front of a central Belgrade police station until their children were released. A striking range of voices have condemned the police conduct. Complaints by the journalists' association and the opposition Centre Party were matched by statements from the Bar Association and even Serbian Orthodox Church Archbishop Grigorije Duric. The EU, for its part, decried the ""acts of hatred and violence"" and called for calm. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, the pop-up roadblocks continue – and so does the ensuing travel chaos for commuters. One resident, while ruefully noting that she had to walk 5km (3 miles) to and from work, described the mood as more like a series of street parties than a protest. But many observers doubt whether this approach will be any more effective than the months of rallies, faculty blockades and half-hearted general strikes.

The 2024 Novi Sad railway disaster

The protest movement started with a relatively simple purpose: to ensure accountability for last November's disaster at Novi Sad railway station, when a concrete canopy at the recently renovated facility in Serbia's second city collapsed, killing 16 people who were standing beneath it. The outpouring of grief was instant – and the outrage swiftly followed. Much of it has been directed at President Vucic. A large section of Serbians have long been uneasy with his ""strongman"" style of leadership, since he came to power in 2012. But others have accepted his party's firm grip on state institutions and much of the media as a trade-off for strong economic growth and improvements in infrastructure. Fury over Serbia station tragedy prompts first arrests

Serbia's largest-ever rally sees 325,000 protest against government The station disaster shattered that tacit agreement. ""We are all under the canopy"" was one slogan frequently seen on banners in the early days of the protests. Others included ""blood on your hands"" and ""corruption kills"". University students took leadership of the movement, demanding full transparency about the railway station project and the prosecution of those responsible for the disaster. Months of protests eventually forced the resignation of Milos Vucevic as prime minister. But he was simply replaced by another Vucic appointee, Djuro Macut – and the protest movement has otherwise achieved little in terms of concrete results.

Serbia: Attacks on journalists reach unprecedented levels amidst ongoing anti-government protests - ipi.media,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxPdXpuOWU2d0lqODUySmtFa0F4MGJDblJHYURzS3JKc3daWlh1WlpFN0N0ajhJWjB3dnhCS1hlVmt3TW5UdXRWNVhLeGdtdlZ0dWxTbXBvZjlnRG1DODdLVjk2dzlrRm1CV0ZaR3JkanhjRnJqVFU0WGNnSGpZRHV3SUxHRWxmY2MwNzViWEZWQzVRaTJzdDZjNlBYVlV6ZVVseEpQR0N6UVFETUVDWTVNbEZiUVNmUQ?oc=5,ipi.media,2025-08-22,https://ipi.media/serbia-attacks-on-journalists-reach-unprecedented-levels-amidst-ongoing-anti-government-protests/,"By IPI contributor Jelena L. Petković

This article is part of a series published by IPI and written by expert guest contributors from across Europe on different threats facing media freedom and independent journalism. This article focuses on the latest surge in attacks on journalists in Serbia in the last week amidst the latest anti-government protests and the state response. The views of the author do not necessarily reflect those of IPI.

Amidst the increasingly violent state response to anti-government protests in Serbia recent days, attacks and pressure on journalists have reached unprecedented levels, deepening what is already one of the worst media freedom crises in Europe.

Death threats and physical attacks against journalists and media workers are now occurring on a near daily basis, as reporters and photojournalists cover violent clashes between riot police, government-backed hooligans and student-led protesters.

Yet even as the law enforcement authorities and the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) led government of President Aleksandar Vučić crack down and the emergency situation for journalists worsens, many in Serbia have the feeling that worse is yet to come.

The Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia (NUNS) told IPI it has now recorded more than 232 different attacks between the beginning of the year and August 22.

More than 42 attacks against journalists were recorded since the first day of August, with 10 occurring during coverage of recent mass protests on August 13, when the latest surge of protests broke out across the country carrying calls for new elections.

“The number includes 52 cases from March until now of assaults, threats, obstruction by the police or when the police did not respond – when the law enforcement officers witness the attacks, they simply turn and walk away,” Rade Đurić, a lawyer at NUNS, told IPI. “We haven’t yet counted hate speech and other forms of pressure. Who knows how many stayed under the radar.”

This high number of attacks on journalists – the most ever recorded in modern Serbia during that time period – and the lack of accountability for the perpetrators, is having a chilling effect on the press as they try to cover the ongoing protests.

Yet even as the tactics of the government and police become increasingly apparent, independent media and civil society in Serbia are again criticising reactions from Europe as lukewarm and insufficient.

“For us, in an authoritarian society, the most dramatic thing is that despite dozens of attacks on journalists a day and many more on citizens, the EU does not respond in a meaningful way,” Veran Matić, chairperson of the management board of the Association of Independent Electronic Media (ANEM), told IPI.

He added: “The citizens of Serbia have been expecting a proper reaction from the European Union for months. There is no adequate response from the EU institutions, which emboldens the government. Every day we have a dozen new attacks on journalists, and this is the new normal.”

Covering the protest movement

Student-led protests began nine months ago after the collapse of a canopy at the renovated railway station in Novi Sad, killing 16 people. Initial demands for the full disclosure of information and accountability for the tragedy became aimed at wider negligence and calls for an end to state corruption.

As the demonstrations morphed into a wider citizen movement and the largest anti-government protests in modern Serbia, professional journalists and media organisations reporting on them were increasingly targeted by government supporters and politicians, who branded them as “foreign mercenaries”, “terrorists” and “anti-Serbs”.

As well as pro-government media and commentators, these verbal denigrations and smears have been increasingly taken up and echoed by SNS politicians and even from the executive, with Vučić himself dangerously branding media organisations N1 and Nova “terrorists” and liars attempting to overthrow his government.

As protests swelled again in Belgrade and cities across the country in recent days, Serbian police have faced condemnation for the use of disproportionate force against civilians and for the tacit permittance of attacks on protesters by government-backed hooligan groups, which has led to violent clashes and numerous injuries. Photojournalists documenting police brutality are often the first in line for these attacks and make a bulk of those injured.

As well as attacks from SNS supporters and hooligans, there have also been numerous allegations and in some cases documented examples of media workers being violently attacked by police while covering the clashes, despite wearing clear PRESS insignia, prompting journalists’ and media organisations in Serbia to warn that a red line has been crossed.

Serbs plan fresh protests as anti-gov't unrest grows - Central European Times,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQcVVkbF8wLXdWR3hqSk1PLUVWc0VHbC1pZmdjbDM5Q1g0RWVjWllaeHNrOUUxTmdVWUZmejZva1paQ2NXOF9JanJlaklqYzU1dW1kTUNpbjlOTVBEOWJmU3lBVUtNcnYyX1FmOHQzMjdUWGFzU3pJc2ZnLTJDeWx0a0xEbmxsY2U5eDA0aVZB?oc=5,Central European Times,2025-06-30,https://centraleuropeantimes.com/serbs-plan-fresh-protests-as-anti-govt-unrest-grows/,"University students in Serbia will lead another round of anti-government protests in the capital city of Belgrade this week, deepening a political crisis that has exposed widening rifts in the country’s institutions and democratic trajectory.

The demonstrations follow street blockades, dozens of arrests, and growing public opposition to the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), accused by protesters of authoritarian overreach and institutional capture.

Demonstrations intensified over the weekend as student-led groups erected makeshift barricades at key intersections in central Belgrade, including Kneza Milosa, Nemanjina and the Gazela Bridge. Police estimated Saturday’s protest turnout at 36,000, while independent observers cited figures as high as 140,000.

Clashes were reported in several locations. Riot police used batons, shields and pepper spray to disperse crowds. According to official figures, 48 police officers were injured, while 22 protesters required medical attention.

Street barricades cleared

Police moved in early on 30 June to dismantle the barricades. The Interior Ministry reported 77 arrests during the operation, with 38 individuals facing criminal charges. Further detentions were reported on 1 July, bringing the total arrests over the weekend to more than 110.

Video footage showed protesters throwing stones and flares at security forces, while several journalists were pushed or obstructed during live reporting near Slavija Square. Rights groups have called for an independent inquiry into the use of force.

“We will not allow foreign-instigated destabilisation,” Gasic said in a televised statement. “Serbia is a lawful state, and protests must remain within legal limits.”

The Belgrade Centre for Human Rights condemned the security response, calling it excessive. Several journalists and bystanders reported being pushed or threatened during the police operation.

Flashpoints multiply

Public anger has grown over the appointment of Bratislav Zivkovic, a former paramilitary commander, to the board of Serbia’s National Theatre. Critics say the move reflects a broader state effort to legitimise figures linked to wartime violence.

Protesters have also pointed to ongoing pressure on independent media and the judiciary, as well as what they call the politicisation of public institutions under Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

Opposition parties have expressed support for the protests but student leaders insist their movement remains unaffiliated. “This is not just about one party,” protest spokesperson Milica Vukovic said on 30 June. “It’s about our right to live in a country where institutions serve citizens, not political strongmen.”

Muted EU reaction

The European Commission (EC) has reiterated its support for Serbia’s EU accession path but has not commented on the recent unrest. Several MEPs have raised concerns over media freedom and the rule of law. In a European Parliament debate on 25 June, MEP Viola von Cramon said, “Serbia continues to regress on key democratic indicators while pretending to align with EU values.”

Protesters plan weekly gatherings

The protest wave was sparked by the 1 November 2024 collapse of a newly built concrete canopy at the railway station in Novi Sad, northern Serbia, which killed 16 people and injured dozens.

The disaster, blamed on substandard construction and opaque public contracts, became a national scandal and a symbol of what protesters describe as systemic corruption and impunity under the SNS. Initial vigils in Novi Sad quickly spread to Belgrade and other cities, evolving into a broader student-led movement demanding accountability, transparency and institutional reform.

The next protest, scheduled for 1 July, will begin at the University of Belgrade and proceed toward the National Assembly. Student organisers are demanding snap elections, the dismissal of Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic, and a reversal of recent controversial public appointments.

Organisers plan to march every week until their demands are addressed. A night vigil is scheduled for 2 July outside the National Theatre. “We are not afraid,” said a statement from Students for Democracy. “We will not look away.”

The protests in Belgrade mirror recent student-led unrest in Slovakia, Georgia and Bulgaria, where democratic backsliding and corruption have become central issues."

Police fired tear gas in the country's capital and several other incidents were reported elsewhere.

In the northern city of Novi Sad, where the anti-Vucic revolt in Serbia started more than nine months ago, groups of young protesters shouted, ""He is finished,"" as they demolished the offices of the president's ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

The demonstrators broke windows on the party's downtown office and carried away some documents and pieces of furniture from inside. The police or Vucic's supporters, who have guarded the office for months, were nowhere to be seen.

In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, police in the evening fired tear gas in at least two locations to disperse the protesters and keep groups of supporters of the opposing camps apart. Protesters in a downtown area scrambled in panic, some tumbling to the ground as they tried to run away.

Vucic told pro-government Informer television that ""the state will win"" as he announced a crackdown on anti-government protesters, accusing them of inciting violence and of being ""enemies of their own country.""

He reiterated earlier claims that the protests have been organized from abroad, offering no evidence.

The unrest throughout Serbia this week marked a serious escalation in largely peaceful demonstrations led by Serbia's university students that have shaken Vucic's firm grip on power in the Balkan country.

Rival groups on Wednesday hurled rocks and bottles at each other amid clouds of smoke and chaos. An army security officer at the SNS party offices at one point fired his gun in the air, saying later he felt his life had been in danger.

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic on Thursday said there were gatherings at some 90 locations in the country the previous evening.

The Serbian president has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms and of allowing organized crime and corruption to flourish in the country, which is a candidate for European Union membership. He denies those allegations.

The EU's Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said the reports of violence were ""deeply concerning.""

""Advancing on the EU path requires citizens can express their views freely and journalists can report without intimidation or attacks,"" Kos added on the social media platform X.

Protesters gathered in large numbers again on Thursday evening in Belgrade, Novi Sad and in some smaller towns, defying sharp warnings against protests from Vucic and other government officials.

On Wednesday evening in the capital, riot police used tear gas to disperse groups of protesters. Police officers formed a cordon around a makeshift camp of Vucic's loyalists outside the presidency building downtown.

Dacic, the interior minister, accused the protesters of attacking governing party loyalists. He said, ""those who broke the law will be identified and sanctioned.""

University students posted on X to accuse the authorities of trying to ""provoke a civil war with the clashes"" at demonstrations. The rallies so far passed for the most part without incident, even while drawing hundreds of thousands of people.

Occasional violence in the past months mostly involved incidents between protesters and the police, rather than between rival groups.

""Police were guarding the regime loyalists who were throwing rocks and firing flares at the protesters,"" a post by the informal group, Students in Blockade, said. The account is run by students from across Serbia who have been protesting the government since late last year.

Demonstrations started in November after a renovated train station canopy crashed in Novi Sad, killing 16 people and triggering accusations of corruption in state-run infrastructure projects.

The protesters are demanding that Vucic call an early parliamentary election, which he has refused to do. Serbia is formally seeking EU membership, but Vucic has maintained strong ties with Russia and China."

In Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, police and SNS supporters loyal to populist President Aleksandar Vucic were absent as dozens of anti-government protesters smashed the windows of the party's offices, threw out furniture and SNS paraphernalia, and splashed paint across the entrance.

""He's gone,"" protesters chanted in unison, referring to Vucic's 13-year-long rule.

Daily protests across Serbia, sparked by the deaths of 16 people when the roof of a renovated railway station in Novi Sad collapsed last November, have rattled the popularity of Vucic and the SNS.

Similar protests were held in towns across the country.

In Belgrade, hundreds of protesters and SNS supporters threw flares and firecrackers at each other on one of the city's main boulevards.

Police in full riot gear charged the anti-government protesters in an effort to force them to move from the area, a Reuters witness said.

Vucic pledged more arrests after the protests.

""I think it is clear they did not want peace and Ghandian protests. There will be more arrests,"" he said in a live broadcast by Belgrade-based private Informer TV.

Earlier on Thursday, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that 27 police officers and around 80 civilians were injured in Wednesday’s clashes, and 47 people had been detained.

Protesters have blamed corruption for the Novi Sad railway station disaster and are demanding early elections in hopes of ousting Vucic and his party.

Students, opposition groups, and anti-corruption watchdogs have accused Vucic and his allies of ties to organized crime, using violence against political rivals, and suppressing media freedoms—allegations they deny.

Violence in Novi Sad leaves dozens injured as nationwide protests over a deadly railway station collapse escalate into street battles.

Supporters of Serbia’s ruling Progressive Party (SNS) clashed with anti-government protesters in Novi Sad on Wednesday evening, throwing flares and firecrackers from the direction of SNS offices. Police intervened to end the standoff, marking a major escalation in the nine-month wave of nationwide demonstrations.

The protests began after 16 people were killed when the roof of a renovated railway station in Novi Sad collapsed last November. Demonstrators blame corruption for the disaster and are demanding early elections to end President Aleksandar Vučić’s 13 years in power.

At a late-night news conference, Vučić, flanked by Interior Minister Ivica Dačić, said 16 police officers and about 60 SNS supporters were injured in Novi Sad. He accused foreign powers of orchestrating the unrest and vowed arrests. Reuters could not independently verify his claims.

Footage showed SNS loyalists using sticks and truncheons to attack protesters, some of whom had bloody faces. Opposition group Move-Change said Vučić’s backers were responsible and that such attacks “violate the right to life and protest.”

In Belgrade, police in full riot gear blocked protesters from approaching a pro-Vučić camp near parliament, and clashed with demonstrators elsewhere who tried to reach local SNS offices.

Students leading the protests called for rallies outside SNS offices in major cities—including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Čačak, and Niš—after Tuesday’s violence in Vrbas, where several protesters were injured in clashes with SNS supporters.

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that protesters had gathered at some 90 locations across the country on Wednesday evening. Nearly 50 protesters were arrested on Wednesday and around 80 civilians and 30 riot police were injured, he said.

Serbia seen months of student-led protests against corruption

It is the latest escalation of thestudent-led demonstrations against Vucic's government that have gripped Serbia since November 2024. These were initially triggered by the collapse of a railway station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people, and was widely blamed on the country's corruption.

The protesters are now demanding that Vucic call an early election.

Vucic has led the Balkan nation for than a decade as both prime minister and president. Under his leadership, Serbia has become increasingly authoritarian and corruption has flourished. Serbia ranks 105 out of 180 countries on Transparency International's 2024 corruption perception index.

A man casts his ballot at a polling station during the local elections in Kosjeric town, Serbia. AFP

Residents of the Serbian town of Kosjeric turned out in droves on Sunday for a municipal election viewed as a high-stakes test for the national government following months of student-led protests.

The vote is the first since protests against the ruling nationalist party erupted in November, when the roof of a newly refurbished train station collapsed in Novi Sad, killing 16.

The catastrophe, largely blamed on deep-seated corruption, spurred protests, putting pressure on populist President Aleksandar Vucic.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Vucic claims the protests are orchestrated by foreign forces and calls it a “attempted coup,” implying that national elections “might be held soon.”

As of 6:00 pm (1600 GMT), “more than 76 percent of those registered have voted”, the local elections chief Sandra Filipovic told journalists.

“There are still two hours left for voting and I suppose the turnout will be even more significant,” she said, noting that it reached 73 percent in the previous local elections in 2021.

The governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) is being challenged by the united independent candidates’ list.

The independent slate features new faces to politics as well as opposition members who have dropped party labels, a model planned for eventual national elections.

The student-led protests have already forced a prime minister to resign, leading to the collapse of the previous government.

In April, parliament elected a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Djuro Macut, a doctor and political newcomer."

In several Serbian cities rallies of supporters of the SNS against blockades and anti-government protests - Serbian Monitor,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxOYzk5TmdTLVZEcmgyTzRrUi10ZWstR20ySF9kTHVQV0xIRE9iNlV4eFh6NHd2R0V0eWt6UHlaQWcwVURnNVlhcVJ4TldyYUZRVW5JRFhwY1hZT3M1UjVwLXhUOFVna2pyN3AxVmJVQ0tGUFBLS2UxaURtXzNmQloyTG5PSHVJWWtLSkpSemZvZzVoem5qZDRRd2h4d1RRZXZ1X2d1Q1E1UTNnSlFpelZHdk0xeGtKb25mX1kzY1V6WVBlMnpuR3JxV1N4ZGl5eTNEY1dieVRXOA?oc=5,Serbian Monitor,2025-08-21,https://www.serbianmonitor.com/en/in-several-serbian-cities-rallies-of-supporters-of-the-sns-against-blockades-and-anti-government-protests/,"Government supporters, at the invitation of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), gathered on Wednesday, August 20, in several cities and towns as a sign of opposition to anti-government protests and blockades that have been organized across Serbia for more than nine months.

Rallies were held, among others, in Vršac, Pančevo, Loznica, Vranje, and Leskovac. In Vršac, participants carried Serbian flags and banners reading “I want my Serbia back,” “I want to move freely,” “I want to study.” The gathering was secured by police, reported a Radio Free Europe correspondent.

In some cities, according to the Beta news agency, local officials from the Serbian Progressive Party were spotted, as well as employees of public and municipal companies and institutions.

At the rally in Subotica, alongside Mayor Stevan Bakić, were also the Provincial Government President Maja Gojković and the Provincial Secretary for Economy and Tourism Nenad Ivanišević.

All the gatherings took place peacefully, without incidents.

Calls to attend were also shared on social media by SNS officials, including some mayors and municipal presidents.

“They have taken away my normal life. They attack my home. I want peace. I want to work. I want to move. I want to study. I want my Serbia back. Fight – against the blockade,” read one post.

The president of the party, Miloš Vučević, also called for rallies “across Serbia,” stating that citizens are “raising their heads” because they are tired of blockades.

Students call on citizens to ‘ignore’ SNS rallies

At the same time, students leading the anti-government protests called on citizens not to go out during those rallies, not to clash, and not to take part in what they called a “performance.” They accused the government of “bringing in people from outside to stage a picture of the ‘people’” and of wanting to “provoke incidents.”

The same appeal was made by citizens gathered in informal assemblies. They called on citizens to ignore the rallies organized by the authorities and to “stay away from suspicious individuals and not fall into the trap.” “They want to provoke unrest, clashes, for someone to get hurt, so they can say we are violent,” read posts on several Instagram accounts.

During the anti-government protests over the past week, there have been incidents and clashes between police and supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party on one side, and demonstrators on the other.

The daily gatherings of demonstrators are a reaction to the protests in the Vojvodina towns of Vrbas and Bačka Palanka on August 12, when government supporters attacked demonstrators with pyrotechnics. Outrage was also sparked by the actions of the police that day, whom demonstrators accused of doing nothing to prevent the attacks.

Government representatives blame the violence on demonstrators, claiming that the police are only preventing clashes.

On the other hand, participants in the anti-government protests accuse the police of brutality and the government of provoking clashes and violence.

On August 17, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić announced that in the next “three or four days the state would make surprising decisions” as a response to the anti-government protests, without giving further details.

For more than nine months, protests have been taking place in Serbia, primarily demanding accountability for the deaths of 16 people in the collapse of the canopy at the Novi Sad Railway Station.

Students leading the protests have also added the demand for early parliamentary elections. They consider this an inevitable step since “the state has done nothing regarding accountability for the tragedy.” At the same time, the government refuses to call early elections.

The police are there to ensure public order and peace, and they acted exclusively for that purpose and for the purpose of defense. The biggest incidents and the burning and destruction of SNS premises were in Novi Sad. As well as the police. In Belgrade, the police were attacked in the streets around the Government of Serbia and in New Belgrade,"" said Dacic.

University networks from Novi Sad, Belgrade, Niš, Kragujevac, Novi Pazar and Kosovska Mitrovica today condemned the ""organized and brutal violence"" that has been perpetrated against citizens throughout Serbia for days, and which, they say, is organized by criminal groups linked to the Serbian Progressive Party, with the full logistical and operational support of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia (MUP).

""Intimidation, physical attacks, the use of pyrotechnics and the pulling of guns on unarmed citizens - as happened in Novi Sad - are a clear sign that the state is captured, and the institutions have been turned into an instrument of repression by one political party,"" said the joint statement of those networks.

It is also warned that the MUP has been turned into the private security of the ruling elite, which does not protect the law but ""the criminal government from citizens"".

They also add that Serbia is no longer a democratic country, because it stifles freedom of speech, distorts facts, prohibits assembly and violently tramples on basic human rights.

Students in the blockade of Novi Sad FTN called on the Serbian Army to stand with the people
The students in the blockade of the Novi Sad Faculty of Technical Sciences (FTN) today called on the Serbian Army to stand with the people.

They call on the army to resist ""the yoke of those who act like occupiers in their own country, those who want to put everything Serbian under their control and bring it in for personal gain.""

""Don't let your uniform become a tool in the hands of those who see people only as an obstacle,"" said the students at the FTN blockade.

On the occasion of last night's incidents in Novi Sad and the official confirmation that members of ""Cobra"" were also present at the protest, students asked ""who ordered the elite military forces to be deployed among the party ranks?""



Belgrade Center for Human Rights: Police protected the safety of SNS members only
The Belgrade Center for Human Rights today condemned the ""biased and discriminatory behavior of the police"", which, especially during the recent protests by citizens throughout Serbia, ""stood aside and protected the safety of exclusively members of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS)"".

EC: The EU strongly condemns all forms of violence, including threats to journalists in Serbia
The European Union is closely monitoring the situation in Serbia after several protests in Serbia, during which demonstrators and journalists were reportedly attacked and intimidated by supporters of the ruling party, while the police did not react.

Therefore, it is essential for the authorities to reduce tensions and initiate a genuine dialogue with the protesting citizens in order to find a sustainable path out of the crisis, says Marko Stojić, a professor in the Department of International Relations and European Studies at the Metropolitan University in Prague, in an interview with NIN.

Stojić, who specializes in European integration, EU enlargement, political parties, and Euroscepticism, also discussed the relationship between Serbia and the EU, as well as the dynamics within the Union.

The political situation in Serbia is extremely tense, the society is divided into two increasingly distant camps. How does a political scene arrive at such a situation, is there a way out of it, and what are the options?

Serbia is currently experiencing a profound institutional, political, and social crisis. The protests that have been shaking the country for months represent the culmination of 13 years of rule by the Serbian Progressive Party (Srpska napredna stranka - SNS), a party that is undoubtedly corrupt and increasingly and obviously criminalized. In an atmosphere of immense distrust in the state apparatus and in a situation where functional democratic institutions have long been absent, civil unrest is a genuine cry from society for justice. The protesting citizens are demanding truth and accountability, and the greatest responsibility naturally falls on those who have held absolute power for years.

In democratic countries, elections are the only acceptable institutional means to resolve deep social conflicts and to exit crises. Therefore, it is essential for the authorities to reduce tensions and initiate a genuine dialogue with the protesting citizens in order to find a sustainable way out of the crisis. Primarily, this would mean reaching an agreement to ensure minimum conditions for holding elections, given that the SNS will do everything in its power to prevent fair elections. This party has spent over a decade establishing its political dominance by using mechanisms that allow it to win elections in advance, controlling the voter registry, the media, the public sector, and financial flows. The party will clearly not relinquish its most crucial sources of power.

However, experience shows that there are very few voices of reason within the government. The authorities live in fear of accountability. After years of accusations of corruption, criminal scandals, and the erosion of institutions, even elections under unfair conditions could lead to a loss of power and raise issues of political and even criminal responsibility for party leaders. In such circumstances, preventing the electoral competition ceases to be a matter of democracy and procedure, becoming instead a matter of mere political survival.

What is your view on the relationship between Serbia and the EU? The accession process has effectively stalled for a long time. What are the main reasons for this, and can it change?

Currently, Serbia is merely a formal candidate for EU membership. In reality, the country has never been as far from membership since 2014, when the accession negotiations began. The last negotiating chapter was opened in December 2021, and there is almost no possibility of the process being unblocked anytime soon. The country finds itself in an undeclared suspension of negotiations with the EU, with the European Commission refraining from formally proposing a suspension so as not to weaken the fragile pro-European forces, to avoid losing at least symbolic influence over the situation in the country, and to prevent further malign influence from Russia.

I believe that the EU has demonstrated a high degree of confusion and misunderstanding of the complex circumstances under which the Western Balkans is approaching the Union. This was particularly evident when the Commission and leading member states supported the controversial ""Jadar"" project by the company ""Rio Tinto."" Such moves further undermined the already fragile credibility of the EU and compromised the ""European idea"" in Serbia – even among the staunchest supporters of integration.

The fundamental reason for the substantive halt in Serbia's European integration, however, is the fact that the authorities have no intention, let alone interest, in working towards the country's accession to the EU. It is now clear that Serbia, under the rule of the Serbian Progressive Party, will not become a member of the Union. On the contrary, the country has been moving further away from meeting the basic membership criteria for over a decade – and will accelerate this process after the end of 2024.

Throughout this year, Serbia has dramatically regressed in key areas essential for EU accession: functional democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Institutions ""captured"" by the ruling party have n"

BELGRADE - Anti-government protesters demolished the offices of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) in the northern city of Novi Sad and clashed with police and SNS supporters in the capital Belgrade on Thursday, a day after violent unrest left dozens injured.

In Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, police and SNS supporters loyal to populist President Aleksandar Vucic were absent as dozens of anti-government protesters smashed the windows of the party's offices, threw out furniture and SNS paraphernalia, and splashed paint across the entrance.

""He's gone,"" protesters chanted in unison, referring to Vucic's 13-year-long rule.

Daily protests across Serbia, sparked by the deaths of 16 people when the roof of a renovated railway station in Novi Sad collapsed last November, have rattled the popularity of Vucic and the SNS.

Similar protests were held in towns across the country.

In Belgrade, hundreds of protesters and SNS supporters threw flares and firecrackers at each other on one of the city's main boulevards.

Police in full riot gear charged the anti-government protesters in an effort to force them to move from the area, a Reuters witness said.

Vucic pledged more arrests after the protests.

""I think it is clear they did not want peace and Ghandian protests. There will be more arrests,"" he said in a live broadcast by Belgrade-based private Informer TV.

Earlier on Thursday, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that 27 police officers and around 80 civilians were injured in Wednesday’s clashes, and 47 people had been detained.

Therefore, it is essential for the authorities to reduce tensions and initiate a genuine dialogue with the protesting citizens in order to find a sustainable path out of the crisis, says Marko Stojić, a professor in the Department of International Relations and European Studies at the Metropolitan University in Prague, in an interview with NIN.

Stojić, who specializes in European integration, EU enlargement, political parties, and Euroscepticism, also discussed the relationship between Serbia and the EU, as well as the dynamics within the Union.

The political situation in Serbia is extremely tense, the society is divided into two increasingly distant camps. How does a political scene arrive at such a situation, is there a way out of it, and what are the options?

Serbia is currently experiencing a profound institutional, political, and social crisis. The protests that have been shaking the country for months represent the culmination of 13 years of rule by the Serbian Progressive Party (Srpska napredna stranka - SNS), a party that is undoubtedly corrupt and increasingly and obviously criminalized. In an atmosphere of immense distrust in the state apparatus and in a situation where functional democratic institutions have long been absent, civil unrest is a genuine cry from society for justice. The protesting citizens are demanding truth and accountability, and the greatest responsibility naturally falls on those who have held absolute power for years.

In democratic countries, elections are the only acceptable institutional means to resolve deep social conflicts and to exit crises. Therefore, it is essential for the authorities to reduce tensions and initiate a genuine dialogue with the protesting citizens in order to find a sustainable way out of the crisis. Primarily, this would mean reaching an agreement to ensure minimum conditions for holding elections, given that the SNS will do everything in its power to prevent fair elections. This party has spent over a decade establishing its political dominance by using mechanisms that allow it to win elections in advance, controlling the voter registry, the media, the public sector, and financial flows. The party will clearly not relinquish its most crucial sources of power.

However, experience shows that there are very few voices of reason within the government. The authorities live in fear of accountability. After years of accusations of corruption, criminal scandals, and the erosion of institutions, even elections under unfair conditions could lead to a loss of power and raise issues of political and even criminal responsibility for party leaders. In such circumstances, preventing the electoral competition ceases to be a matter of democracy and procedure, becoming instead a matter of mere political survival.

What is your view on the relationship between Serbia and the EU? The accession process has effectively stalled for a long time. What are the main reasons for this, and can it change?

Currently, Serbia is merely a formal candidate for EU membership. In reality, the country has never been as far from membership since 2014, when the accession negotiations began. The last negotiating chapter was opened in December 2021, and there is almost no possibility of the process being unblocked anytime soon. The country finds itself in an undeclared suspension of negotiations with the EU, with the European Commission refraining from formally proposing a suspension so as not to weaken the fragile pro-European forces, to avoid losing at least symbolic influence over the situation in the country, and to prevent further malign influence from Russia.

I believe that the EU has demonstrated a high degree of confusion and misunderstanding of the complex circumstances under which the Western Balkans is approaching the Union. This was particularly evident when the Commission and leading member states supported the controversial ""Jadar"" project by the company ""Rio Tinto."" Such moves further undermined the already fragile credibility of the EU and compromised the ""European idea"" in Serbia – even among the staunchest supporters of integration.

The fundamental reason for the substantive halt in Serbia's European integration, however, is the fact that the authorities have no intention, let alone interest, in working towards the country's accession to the EU. It is now clear that Serbia, under the rule of the Serbian Progressive Party, will not become a member of the Union. On the contrary, the country has been moving further away from meeting the basic membership criteria for over a decade – and will accelerate this process after the end of 2024.

Throughout this year, Serbia has dramatically regressed in key areas essential for EU accession: functional democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Institutions ""captured"" by the ruling party have n"

No time? blue News summarizes for you Nationwide protests against President Vucic and his Progressive Party are escalating in Serbia.

The protests were triggered by the collapse of a train station roof in Novi Sad. Corruption and nepotism are said to be responsible for the construction defects at the newly renovated station.

The movement, initiated by students, has spread to over 30 cities and now unites different population groups of various ethnicities.

The protests in Serbia escalate once again. In the second-largest city of Novi Sad in the north of the country, people smashed the windows of the headquarters of the ruling Progressive Party (SNS), broke into the building and removed objects, as reported by Serbian media.

In Belgrade, SNS supporters attacked the government opponents with fireworks. The atmosphere was chaotic, the media reported. Rallies took place in more than 30 locations - in front of the local offices of the Progressive Party.

Dozens of people, including members of the police, were injured in clashes between protesters and security forces.

Who or what are the people protesting against?

People are protesting against corruption and the authoritarian tendencies of Alexander Vucic's government and the Progressive Party, to which he belongs. He has held various offices in Serbia since 2012. One of the central demands of the demonstrators is new elections. Another is the investigation into the collapse of a newly renovated train station roof in Novi Sad.

What triggered the protests?

On November 1, 2024, a canopy of the newly renovated Novi Sad train station collapsed, killing 16 people. Independent experts and members of the opposition blame the government for the construction defects, claiming that corruption and nepotism are rampant under the government. Since the accident in Serbia's second-largest city, protests have flared up again and again.

Who is opposing the government?

The protests have started with students. They are occupying or blockading universities across the country, ensuring that people all over the country are taking to the streets against the Vucic government.

The largest demonstrations to date took place in March with over 300,000 protesters. The movement has now grown beyond the student population.

Balkan Insight magazine highlights the fact that members of different ethnic groups are fighting together against the government as particularly noteworthy. In previous decades in Serbia, it was mostly individual ethnic groups fighting against others.

Where are the demonstrations taking place?

Starting in Novi Sad, the site of the train station disaster, the protests spread to other cities with universities. The largest: Belgrade, Nis, Kragujevac, Cacak. The most recent demonstrations took place in over 30 places.

How dangerous are the protests for President Vucic?

The protests against Vucic are reminiscent of those against former President Solobodan Milosevic in the fall of 2000. More people are taking part in the current demonstrations. Back then, the demonstrators stormed parliament and Milosevic, one of the architects of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, fled. He later died in custody before the trial against him at the International Criminal Court began.

The current Serbian head of state is far removed from this. During the largest protests in March, Vucic reassuringly declared that the government recognized the dissatisfaction and had to change. In practically the same breath, he complained that many of the demonstrators were drunk and that the police had found weapons caches. He did not provide any proof of this.

However, he then went on to blame the opposition for sending their children onto the streets or foreign forces that wanted to weaken Serbia. He recently described the demonstrators as criminals and ""Ustasha"" - the fascist Croatian fighting group that fought alongside the German Wehrmacht in the Balkans during the Second World War.

There are repeated reports that individual police units are not taking action against protesters, most recently in attacks on local offices of the ruling Progress Party in Novi Sad - which Vucic immediately criticized.

Serbia has been plunged into its most severe political unrest in years, with protesters attacking government and ruling party offices, sparking fiery clashes with police across the country. What began as outrage over corruption allegations and tragic infrastructure failures has now spiraled into a broader confrontation between President Aleksandar Vucic’s government and opposition movements. The latest wave of violence has raised fears of instability, with Belgrade accusing foreign powers of fueling the unrest and outside actors weighing in with warnings of further consequences.

The protests, initially led by student groups, erupted in 2024 following the deadly collapse of a railway station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people. The disaster was widely seen as a symbol of government negligence and corruption. Demonstrators quickly demanded accountability, early elections, and an end to what they described as a culture of impunity within the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

While demonstrations initially took the form of peaceful marches and vigils, frustrations have increasingly boiled over into violent confrontations. On August 13, 2025, tensions escalated dramatically in Valjevo, about 100 kilometers west of Belgrade, after videos of police using heavy-handed tactics against protesters circulated online. Outrage over the footage sparked rallies in several cities, which soon descended into chaos.

Masked demonstrators hurled stones and flares at the SNS offices, smashing windows before setting them ablaze. Videos shared on social media showed flames engulfing parts of the building before firefighters brought the situation under control. In Belgrade and other cities, riot police clashed with demonstrators who threw Molotov cocktails, fireworks, and flares at officers and their vehicles.

President Aleksandar Vucic, facing the most serious challenge to his rule in over a decade, delivered a defiant response. In a video message on August 16, he described the violence as “an expression of total weakness” on the part of his opponents. “Alongside all the bad things happening to our country and to us, there is one good thing – all the masks are off,” Vucic declared. “People see everything: the protesters’ nervousness and hysteria are growing, and the violence is becoming more obvious, because they have nothing left to offer.”

Vucic warned that “the time of accountability has come” and promised that “everyone who burned and destroyed will be held responsible and punished for their crimes.” He emphasized that Serbia would not be dragged into civil conflict: “No civil war will be allowed, and no one is stronger than the state, even with foreign support.”

The Serbian president has long accused Western powers of attempting to destabilize his government. Earlier this week, he drew parallels between Serbia’s unrest and the so-called “color revolutions” that swept through parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He claimed that foreign funding and influence were playing a role in the unrest, though he offered no direct evidence.

The turmoil has drawn swift reactions from neighboring countries and global powers. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused the European Union of seeking to undermine the governments of Hungary, Slovakia, and Serbia, claiming Brussels is punishing leaders who prioritize national sovereignty over alignment with EU policies. “The EU is trying to topple governments that don’t obey its dictates,” Szijjarto argued, presenting the unrest in Serbia as part of a wider geopolitical struggle.

Russia, a longtime ally of Belgrade, also issued a statement through its Foreign Ministry. Moscow denounced the violence, claiming it had “far exceeded civilized protest” and warning that it “cannot remain unresponsive” to events in “brotherly Serbia.” The Kremlin expressed confidence that Vucic’s government would restore order but signaled that it is watching developments closely.

These external responses highlight Serbia’s delicate geopolitical position. Sandwiched between East and West, the country has sought to balance EU accession talks with close ties to Russia and, increasingly, China. The current unrest may force Belgrade into a tighter embrace with Moscow, particularly if Vucic sees the EU as complicit in the turmoil.

Meanwhile, opposition groups in Serbia have accused the government of hiding behind conspiracy theories to avoid addressing public grievances. Activists point to years of corruption allegations, erosion of press freedoms, and authoritarian tendencies under Vucic’s leadership as the true cause of popular discontent.

Student organizations that once championed peaceful protest have become divided, with some condemning the violent turn while others argue that the government’s unwillingness to listen has left no alternative. “We tried dialogue, we tried peaceful marches, but the government only re"

The months-long student-led demonstrations, initially sparked by a deadly railway station disaster, have intensified, with recent events including the setting ablaze of an SNS office in Valjevo and confrontations in Belgrade and Novi Sad. Protesters are expressing anger over alleged police brutality and systemic corruption, demanding snap elections and a restoration of democratic principles.

Key Takeaways

Protests against the ruling SNS have escalated, involving clashes with police and attacks on party offices.

Incidents of alleged police brutality have fueled public anger and solidarity among protesters.

The protests, initially student-led, have gained broader support and are seen as the most significant challenge to President Aleksandar Vučić’s government.

Demands include snap elections and a restoration of the rule of law and democracy.

Escalation of Unrest

The recent wave of protests has seen a dramatic increase in intensity, with demonstrators targeting SNS offices in various cities, including Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Valjevo. In Valjevo, an opposition councillor described the scenes as the most dramatic in the city’s history. The Serbian Interior Minister reported arrests and injuries, vowing that law violations would not be tolerated. Riot police have used tear gas to disperse crowds, and reports of police brutality against protesters, including minors, have surfaced.

Roots of the Protests

The current unrest can be traced back to a deadly railway station collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024, which many attributed to corruption and institutional failure. This tragedy, coupled with an alleged physical assault by SNS members on peaceful student protesters, ignited a broader movement. Generation Z has become a significant force, with protests shattering turnout records and coalescing around a mission to restore democracy and the rule of law, which critics argue have been eroded under President Aleksandar Vučić’s increasingly authoritarian rule.

Political Landscape and Future Prospects

Experts suggest these protests represent the most serious challenge to President Vučić’s tenure, potentially making his party electorally vulnerable for the first time since 2012. While the regime’s collapse is not seen as imminent, public dissatisfaction is growing. However, challenges remain, including the fragmentation of opposition parties and mistrust between student leaders and established political groups. The government is expected to potentially tighten its grip on power and further erode democratic foundations, despite potential backlash from the European Union.

Supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) threw flares and firecrackers at anti-government protesters in Novi Sad on Wednesday evening, prompting police to intervene to end the standoff, a major escalation of nine-month-long protests in Serbia.

The student-led protests in Serbia first started in November after a train station canopy collapsed in Novi Sad, killing 16 people and triggering accusations of corruption in state infrastructure projects. 

Protests have since drawn hundreds of thousands of people, shaking President Aleksandar Vucic’s firm grip on power. His supporters have recently started organising counter-demonstrations, fuelling fears of possible violence. 

Read moreWhy has the EU kept silent on Serbia’s massive protest movement?

At a news conference late on Wednesday, Vucic, flanked by Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, said 16 police officers and around 60 SNS backers have been injured in Novi Sad. He also accused unidentified foreign powers of orchestrating riots and pledged arrests.

""Persons who violated the law will be apprehended ... Tonight, we have averted a catastrophic scenario planned by someone from abroad,"" he said.

Vucic did not provide evidence to substantiate his allegations.

Footage by private N1 TV showed flares and firecrackers being thrown at protesters in Novi Sad from the direction of the SNS offices. It also showed anti-government protesters, some with bloody faces, saying Vucic's backers used sticks and truncheons to attack them.

Protesters then smashed office windows as riot police were deployed outside to guard the building.

Opposition Move-Change movement said Vucic's loyalists have been responsible for the clashes.

""Attacks on people with pyrotechnic devices violate their right to life and protest,"" it said in a statement.

In the capital city of Belgrade, police in full riot gear blocked anti-government protesters from approaching the area in a park near the parliament building where Vucic's supporters have been camping since March.

Elsewhere in Belgrade, anti-government protesters clashed with police who prevented them from approaching local SNS offices.

The protesters have blamed corruption for the Novi Sad railway roof collapse and have demanded early elections that they hope would remove Vucic and his party from power after 13 years.

Students, opposition, and anti-corruption watchdogs have accused Vucic and his allies of ties to organised crime, violence against rivals and curbing media freedoms, something they deny.

On Wednesday evening, students who are leading the protests called supporters to protest in front of SNS offices in major cities in Serbia, including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Cacak and Nis, after several protesters were injured in clashes with SNS in the town of Vrbas on Tuesday evening."

In the western town of Valjevo on Saturday, demonstrators set fire to the offices of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) following three days of clashes with riot police. Earlier in the week, protesters in Novi Sad stormed another SNS office, leaving more than 60 people injured.

Addressing the nation on Sunday, Vucic denounced the unrest as “pure terrorism,” alleging that the protests were being coordinated from abroad. “Our country is in grave danger… Unless we take tougher steps, it’s only a matter of days before [the protesters] kill someone,” he warned.

The demonstrations began in 2024 after the collapse of a railway station roof in Novi Sad that killed 16 people. Protesters accused the government of corruption and demanded early elections.

Vucic has repeatedly characterized the violence as an attempted regime change, a view echoed by Russia, which earlier described the unrest as a possible “color revolution.” Moscow expressed confidence in Serbia’s leadership to restore stability, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urging Western powers not to interfere.

While Serbia is officially seeking EU membership, Vucic has maintained close ties with Moscow, particularly over discounted natural gas supplies.

The European Commission, however, has voiced concern over the unrest. EU Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos warned that Belgrade’s handling of the crisis could influence Serbia’s prospects for EU accession."

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has pledged to take tough measures to restore order after anti-government protests across the country turned violent this week.

On Saturday, demonstrators in the western town of Valjevo set fire to the offices of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) following three days of clashes with riot police. Earlier in the week, protesters in Novi Sad stormed and damaged an SNS headquarters, leaving over 60 people injured.

In a televised address on Sunday, Vucic accused the rioters of ""pure terrorism"" and suggested the protests were orchestrated from abroad.

""Our country is in grave danger... Unless we undertake tougher steps it is a question of days when [the protesters] will kill someone,"" Vucic warned.

Protests in Serbia first broke out in 2024 after a railway station roof collapsed in Novi Sad, killing 16 people. Demonstrators alleged government corruption and demanded early elections.

Vucic has repeatedly suggested the violence is an attempt at regime change, a view also shared by Russia. The Kremlin said in June that anti-government demonstrations in Serbia could be an attempted ""color revolution,"" and expressed confidence that the Serbian leadership could restore calm. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged Western nations to refrain from interfering in Serbia's domestic affairs.

Serbia is formally seeking EU membership. However, Vucic has maintained historically strong ties with Moscow, relying on it for discounted natural gas supplies.
