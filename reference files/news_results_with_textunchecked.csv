A double bind: How unrest and geopolitics could end Serbia’s government - European Council on Foreign Relations,https://ecfr.eu/article/a-double-bind-how-unrest-and-geopolitics-could-end-serbias-government/,European Council on Foreign Relations,2025-02-06,"This winter has seen Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic skating on dangerously thin ice. Mass student-led anticorruption protests have led to the resignation of the prime minister, Milos Vucevic, as well as several other members of his government. Last week, the president hinted that the turmoil could lead to a snap parliamentary election come spring.

But public anger and Vucic’s collapsing government are far from his only problems. Even before the protests, the president’s longstanding “à la carte” approach to foreign policy of hedging Serbia between the West and Russia (with a side order of China) seemed to be in trouble. Both the European Union and Russia have been pressing Belgrade to choose a side. Now, Vucic has found himself with very little international sympathy for his domestic woes—and very little room for manoeuvre.

This gives Europeans a key opportunity to help steer events towards stability and democratic progress while minimising the risk of regional spillover. To prevent prolonged instability and bring Serbia back on track, the EU should support civil society, address regional tensions, and reinforce Serbia’s European trajectory.

Some things aren’t new in Belgrade

The mass student-led protests began last November after the roof of the Novi Sad railway station collapsed, killing 15 people and severely injuring 2 others, with many Serbians holding government corruption responsible. Protestors grievances have since compounded, citing the mismanagement of public funds and poor governance, on top of existing dissatisfaction with a lack of media freedom, dysfunctional rule of law and a deliberate lack of electoral reform, not to mention Vucic’s ties to corruption and organised crime. Now, they are demanding a systematic change in how the country is governed and who governs it.

In many ways, this is nothing new. Serbians frequently protest against widespread corruption, election fraud, and the illiberal role of Vucic, with wide-scale anti-government demonstrations in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2023. Until recently, however, Vucic has been able to keep a lid on political opposition by labelling them as foreign agents and using arrests, police force, and intimidation.

This time, however, the tide is turning. Vucic has repeatedly dismissed the protestors and their complaints (and has even leaped to the defence of a driver who rammed into a crowd of protestors and caused severe injuries). But he has not been able to quell Serbians’ anger. The current wave of protests have gathered traction among broad sections of society—they have the support of around two-thirds of the population and are the largest since 2000, when mass protests helped oust then-president Slobodan Milosevic.

Trouble inside and out

Such a clear display of domestic unpopularity for Vucic has affected his international partners’ willingness to stand behind him. On the one hand, Russia has publicly warned Serbia against descending into “chaos”. While Moscow is unlikely to support a leader halfway out the door, it will not give up on Serbia easily. Rather than support Vucic, it is likely Russia will attempt to mobilise the pro-Russia population in Serbia against him, or any other government that takes another step towards Europe. On the other hand, the EU has reaffirmed the need to protect citizens and protesters, but has largely stayed silent rather than rushing to Vucic’s aid in the name of stability as has been the case in the past.

Vucic has neither cultivated strong relations with the EU nor Russia, both of which questioned Serbia’s reliability as a partner long before the protests broke out

This risks compounding Vucic’s struggles to maintain his “à la carte” foreign policy. Throughout his tenure, he has positioned Serbia between the EU (for its economic and funding benefits) and Putin’s Russia (for undermining Kosovo’s independence, its gas and its fondness of illiberal rule), while snacking on other economies such as China’s. In the short-term, Belgrade’s ability to avoid full alignment with any specific bloc allowed it to play its own game and make economic gains. It has continued to build relationships by signing commercial agreements with countries like Egypt, Israel, and South Korea. But in the long term, Vucic has neither cultivated strong relations with the EU nor Russia, both of which questioned Serbia’s reliability as a partner long before the protests broke out.

For Brussels, Serbia’s dealings with Moscow have been a cause for concern. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Serbia has failed to join the EU in sanctioning Russia, and Vucic has recently offered himself as a connection for mediating between Ukraine and Russia, citing Serbia’s long friendship with Moscow. More recently, the president appointed two pro-Russian and US-sanctioned individuals as new members of his cabinet, even after the news on a Serbian agent for Russian influence within EU institutional bodies.

"Protests over train station collapse grip Serbia, demand government action - Al Jazeera English",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/15/thousands-protest-in-serbia-as-anger-over-corruption-swells,Al Jazeera English,2025-02-15,"Students march in Serbia, seeking justice for train station victims and accountability for corruption and nepotism.

Tens of thousands of students have descended on the town of Kragujevac in central Serbia, the latest in a series of protests to rock the Balkan country after the deadly collapse of a train station roof last year.

Fifteen people were killed on November 1 when a roof collapsed at a train station in the city of Novi Sad, fuelling longstanding anger over corruption and nepotism.

Since then, mass demonstrations have grown into Serbia’s largest protest movement in years and represent a threat to populist President Aleksandar Vucic’s decade-long grip on power.

In near-freezing temperatures, students arrived in Kragujevac from across Serbia by bus and even on foot, beating drums, blowing whistles, and holding up the country’s flag.

The protesters planned to block one of the city’s main boulevards for 15 hours and 15 minutes, in a tribute to the train station victims. They also held 15 minutes of silence.

“We are here to fight for a better tomorrow, against corruption,” said 20-year-old Jovan, who drove from the capital Belgrade.

Student protestors have enjoyed broad support from Serbia’s public, many of whom blame the Novi Sad tragedy on corruption and nepotism within Vucic’s government, allegations authorities deny.

Verica, a 52-year-old professor from the city, joined the protest with her teenage daughter.

“I have not been so happy and proud for a long time,” she said. “I am proud of their persistence.”

Students demand change

The university student-led movement has put increasing pressure on Serbia’s government, spurring the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including Prime Minister Milos Vucevic at the end of January.

Elsewhere, 13 people have been charged over the train station disaster. But this has done little to quell the demonstrations.

Since the accident, students have staged daily protests, taking over university buildings and blocking highways and squares.

“We will stay here until the blockade ends,” said Djordje Vujovic, 22, a mechanical engineering student.

The students are demanding that authorities publish documents relating to the station roof collapse. They also want justice for those responsible, the dismissal of charges against protesting students, and a greater budget for higher education.

Ivan and Ivana, 23-year-old mathematics students, were among a group of about 400 people who had walked for four days to reach Kragujevac from Belgrade.

“We wanted to show the people living in the country that we support them,” Ivan said. “We do not think only about the people in Belgrade.”"

Serbian Students to Government: “You Have Blood on Your Hands” - Foreign Policy In Focus,https://fpif.org/serbian-students-to-government-you-have-blood-on-your-hands/,Foreign Policy In Focus,2025-02-05,"For 15 minutes each day for the last three months, the uninterrupted silence in Serbia is an impressive manifestation of power, unity, and determination.

A newly constructed canopy collapsed in front of the central station in Novi Sad on November 1, 2024 at 11:52 am. Fifteen people lost their lives and two others were seriously injured. This tragedy now represents a powerful symbol of a state corruption, ineptitude, graft, and criminality. The motto of the student revolt in Serbia became “You have blood on your hands.”

Under President Aleksandar Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), which has ruled the country for over 12 years, Serbian democracy has obviously collapsed along with part of the railway station in Novi Sad. Still, Vučić has followers in the country and semi-allies all around the globe that have their own agendas. Moscow wants to keep a finger in that part of Europe. The European Union is counting on Serbia’s lithium and would also like to diminish Putin’s influence in that part of the Balkans. The Chinese are already business partners (including the construction of the collapsed canopy).

As it turns out, the United States also has some interests in the country. Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, happily posed for the cameras in Belgrade where he is reportedly working on a deal to build a Trump-branded hotel. Ironically enough, the site for the future hotel is that of the General Staff Building in Belgrade bombed by NATO in 1999. Various Gulf states are expected to provide the necessary capital. Many Serbian students and many citizens are not impressed.

Students Have Had Enough

In their recent letter to students around the world, students from the Faculty of Dramatic Arts from Belgrade declare: “The world is on the brink of collapse, representative democracy is failing, and our future is at risk. This is the only way to take control and change the course of the world. There are countless reasons for a blockade, and you know best what yours is.”

For the last three months, Serbian students have engaged in ever-growing protests, blockades, and a general strike that has involved tens of thousands, even occasionally 100,000 people as other citizens join. Each day at 11:52 am, protestors stop for 15 minutes of silence for the victims. This action resonates with undeniable power, for it derives not from resignation but well-articulated revolt. Before and after the silence, protestors grab for their whistles, which is the only weapon they use. The revolt is spreading.

The students are demanding full documentation of the reconstruction of the railway station, prosecution of those responsible for the tragedy, criminal charges against the people who attacked students, professors, and citizens at earlier commemorative gatherings, and the dismissal of charges against all those arrested and detained at those protests.

Some documents about the reconstruction have been released; the charges against the arrested students have been dismissed. Serbian prosecutors have also indicted 13 people for their role in the disaster, including the former minister for construction, transport, and infrastructure who resigned days after it occurred. The Serbian prime minister also stepped down. But protesters have said that more must be done to hold people politically and criminally accountable. The students aren’t demanding the resignation of the president, but other protestors are calling for this.

The movement in Serbia continuous to grow. On January 27, students, supported by their professors, public figures, judges, farmers, lawyers, journalists, medical staff, taxi drivers, and employees of the state electricity company blocked a major intersection in Belgrade. This action followed calls for a general strike when many people stopped work and schools, as well as small businesses, closed. An estimated 100,000 people attended a demonstration in Belgrade, and anti-government rallies have spread to more than 100 provincial towns and villages nationwide. Farmers are forming chains around the students with their tractors to protect them from government thugs who have crashed into crowds with cars or hit protesters randomly with batons.

Parents, neighbors, and strangers are showing solidarity by bringing coffee, food and blankets for active participants. Over the weekend, some 900 people walked and another 400 cycled 80 kilometers from Belgrade to Novi Sad, helping to block bridges that have been rebuild after NATO aircraft destroyed three of them during their controversial military intervention against Yugoslavia in 1999. A huge number of motorcycles followed. The blockade of Novi Most lasted 27 hours and ended when participants thoroughly cleaned the bridge and its environs. Later in the day Belgrade taxi drivers arrived in large numbers to take home those who came by foot two days previously. New actions and locations will be announced shortly.

Serbia’s Mass Protests Against a Crony-Capitalist Government - Jacobin magazine,https://jacobin.com/2025/02/serbia-protests-novi-sad-railway,Jacobin magazine,2025-02-01,"Soon after the roof canopy of Novi Sad’s central train station collapsed last November 1, killing fifteen people, a TV reporter asked local journalist Igor Mihaljević to respond to the event. With devastating and incisive judgement, he offered the context missing in Western media coverage of the incident and the protests of the last few months. For one, Mihaljević noted, this was the latest incident in the often tragic history of Serbia’s second-largest city. In its past, Novi Sad suffered the genocidal Hungarian army campaign that massacred Jews, Serbs, and Romani across the region. That was in the same era as the devastating military occupation of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany and its client states. More recently, there was the seventy-eight-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999, which killed 527 Yugoslavs and hobbling major cities like Novi Sad by taking out key infrastructure. But this time, Mihaljević argued, was different — for now it was the Serbian state itself killing its people. The train station collapse has left both the city and the nation in shock, triggering primal fears of the sky falling overhead. Many Serbs, especially in Novi Sad, now regard overhead structures with suspicion, with some even avoiding the newly constructed, Chinese-funded high-speed railway. However, the aftermath has also sparked a powerful wave of protests, so intense that they threaten to topple President Aleksandar Vučić, sending shock waves through his corrupt Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).

Student Protests Led by student organizers from over thirty universities and faculties — most notably the faculty of dramatic arts in Belgrade, which began the call to action in late November — the movement has rallied around four key demands. One is the release of all internal documents related to renovations at the Novi Sad railway station, carried out by Serbian Railway Infrastructure, the Serbian state, China Railway International Co. Ltd., and China Communications Construction Company Ltd., which began the station’s construction in 2021. The other demands are the dismissal of all charges against arrested and detained students and young protesters who have been demonstrating since the canopy collapsed; the filing of criminal charges and the prosecution of those responsible for the attacks on students and professors; and a 20 percent increase in budget allocations for public higher-education institutions in Serbia to cover material expenses. Since November, students have organized massive strikes, with such protests as a gathering of over 100,000 people at Belgrade’s Slavija Square on December 22. The protests continued into the New Year, with demonstrators declaring there was nothing to “celebrate” until justice was achieved. They demonstrations are still ongoing, having recently forced the resignations of prime minister Milos Vučević and Novi Sad’s mayor Milan Đurić on January 28. Students have held assemblies and effectively conveyed their message to the media. With a keen sense for Instagramable moments, they have gracefully steered social media campaigns, often featuring overhead drone footage of the protests and eye-catching visuals. Their actions have not only challenged state power, but their demands — particularly for criminal charges and prosecution — offer a stark critique of the deeper systemic rot: a corrupt judicial system that upholds a mafia state and a government that not only fails its people but is complicit in their deaths. What began as a response in Serbia’s major cities has now evolved into a nationwide movement, spreading to smaller towns as well. As noted by Novi Sad activist and scholar Aleksandar Matković on X/Twitter, a map of Serbia showing protests happening across almost all municipalities nationwide shows that the situation is likely to escalate into either a government crisis or more conflict. The events have also sparked deep cultural anxieties tied to national identity. This Monday, the Serbian Orthodox Church published an article damning the student protests, asserting that they were pushing an “anti-Saint Sava, anti-Christian and anti-Serbian narrative and way of life.” This claim that students live in a “parallel universe” was walked back in a statement on Tuesday, which clarified that the text did not reflect the stance of the Church’s top cleric, Patriarch Porfirije. Recently, the protests have intensified into violence, with protesters engaging in fierce clashes with supporters of the ruling SNS party. On Tuesday night at around 3:00 a.m., a group of SNS supporters launched an attack on students in Novi Sad. Many Serbians were especially shocked by a series of interviews widely covered in media in which SNS supporters from the city of Jagodina denounced the students. One older man even said that he would welcome attacks on his daughter if she were protesting.

Are Serbian Protests Starting To Loosen Vucic's Grip On Power? - Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty,https://www.rferl.org/a/serbian-protests-president-vucic-government/33304413.html,Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty,2025-02-06,"BELGRADE -- With mass protests sweeping the nation, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is facing what could be the biggest challenge yet to his political power.

What began as student demands for accountability after 15 people were killed in the collapse of a concrete canopy in Novi Sad has evolved into a broader movement opposing what protesters say is the deteriorating rule of law and systemic corruption under Vucic. Over the last three months, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest in over 200 cities and towns.

""This is not only the most serious political crisis of the government but also a deep social crisis. The students are not looking for a change of government but a correction of the system,"" political analyst Bosko Jaksic told RFE/RL's Balkan Service.

One-Month Strike

The protests are multiplying and have become a focal point for a variety of social groups, each with their own complaints.

University teachers have voiced support for the students, but they are also raising concerns about the decline in academic freedom. Farmers have protected the students from angry motorists by bringing their tractors to blockades, but they are also demanding improved agricultural conditions and increased subsidies.

Separate protests have also been held by public transportation workers, pensioners, and education staff, among others.

Parts of the judiciary -- often criticized as lacking independence -- have also come on board. Seventeen judges from the high court in Belgrade have publicly endorsed the demands of the students in an unprecedented open letter. Judges from the cities of Nis and Kragujevac have also lent their support.

Lawyers from the Serbian Bar Association have also announced a one-month strike in support of the protests, drastically slowing down judicial proceedings.

Edward P. Joseph, a lecturer at the Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University, told CNN that normally judges ""would never dare to raise their head in such public fashion"" and the fear factor is now gone.

While some city dwellers have expressed frustrations with protesters snarling traffic, 61 percent of Serbians support the blockades and protests, according to a survey conducted by the Belgrade-based Center for Research, Transparency, and Accountability.

'Fed Up With Corruption'

The demonstrations have revealed a significant weakness in Vucic's system of authority. While the presidency is a largely ceremonial position, Vucic amassed significant power as the leader of the ruling conservative-nationalist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). While he stepped down from that position in 2023, he is still widely regarded as the main decision-maker.

Chiefly concerned with fostering ties with domestic and foreign investors, Vucic's administration has underestimated the likelihood of opposition from a professional class fed up with corruption and clientelism, observers of Serbian politics say.

""It seems that Vucic is constantly making concessions in areas, where just days ago, he said he wouldn't budge. The aura of an infallible leader, an ultimate authority for his voters, is beginning to erode,"" said Nikola Burazer from the Belgrade-based Center for Contemporary Politics.

For example, Vucic initially rejected the students' request for the release of documentation regarding the reconstruction of the Novi Sad railway station. However, he later instructed the government and the prosecutor's office to make the papers public.

And, crucially, there are signs that Vucic is starting to lose support in one of his key strongholds: the media.

Since the protests began over three months ago, Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), the state-owned public broadcaster, had mostly been ignoring the protests.

That changed last weekend when RTS -- which had also been targeted by demonstrators -- opened its flagship television news program with the protests in Novi Sad. The broadcaster ran drone footage that showed tens of thousands of protesters blocking three bridges over the Danube River and bringing the city to a standstill.

Staff at Radio Television Vojvodina, RTS's sister network in Serbia's autonomous province, staged a walkout in protest at their coverage and performed an alternative reading of the news.

This shift, Burazer said, is a sign that the state broadcaster had ""reacted to the pressure of the students and the wider public, and perhaps is the result of a changing atmosphere in society.""

Milosevic's Minister

Media has always been the bedrock of Vucic's power. In 1998, he was appointed information minister by former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, who died in 2006 while on trial for war crimes at The Hague.

During his time as information minister -- a period that included the war in Kosovo and NATO's intervention in the conflict -- Vucic introduced harsh penalties for no"
Major anti-corruption protests in Serbia add to pressure on President Vučić - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/student-led-protests-in-serbia-mark-railway-station-deaths-blamed-on-graft,The Guardian,2025-02-02,"Serbia’s powerful populist leader Aleksandar Vučić was facing his biggest challenge yet as student-led demonstrations intensified at the weekend in what was being called the Balkan country’s greatest ever protest movement.

Three months to the day after a concrete canopy collapsed at the entrance of Novi Sad’s railway station, tens of thousands of protesters converged on the northern city, blockading its three bridges in commemoration of the 15 people killed in the accident. The tragedy has been blamed squarely on government ineptitude and graft.

“What we are seeing are the greatest street protests in the history of Serbia,” said Dejan Bagarić, a master’s student speaking from the city. “There’s never been anything like it, people are really animated because everybody has had enough of corruption and this government is very corrupt.”

Saturday’s outpouring of dissent – the culmination of sit-ins and protests that began in November – have focused on what demonstrators have described as the government’s striking unwillingness to accept any accountability for the tragedy. Reconstruction of the station was carried out in collaboration with a Chinese state consortium, as part of a large infrastructure project that critics contend paid little, if any, attention to safety regulations.

“There was no transparency, no public tenders for the contract and then when the accident happened, no desire for justice,” said Čedomir Stojković, a leading human rights lawyer who filed a criminal complaint that eventually spurred prosecutors to launch an inquiry. “Instead, the government did what it always does, it went ahead with a full-scale cover-up. There’s a lot of solidarity, a lot of empathy for the students, more and more people are coming out in support of them, professors, farmers, everyone.”

By last week the anti-government rallies had spread to more than 100 provincial towns and villages nationwide.

The scale of the protests had, said Stojković, proved “beyond any doubt” that the demonstrations were not only fuelled by disgust over corruption, an ill that has come to be identified with everything that is wrong with the EU candidate nation, but were a way for citizens to vent their unhappiness with their nationalist president’s increasingly authoritarian rule.

For a generation raised on the internet, knowledge of the world beyond impoverished Serbia is readily available. Also unprecedented is the ability to rapidly arrange protests by circumventing state-controlled media – tens of thousands of striking students participated in a 24-hour blockade of a major intersection in Belgrade last week.

Vučić had faced similar protests last year following allegations of rigged elections, facilitated, opponents say, by a media landscape that remains one of the most censored in Europe. Unlike these demonstrations, however, it was opposition parties, themselves often discredited, who led the backlash.

“People want the government and Vučić to finally go,” said Stojković, who participated as a student in mass protests over 25 years ago against Slobodan Milošević, the late Yugoslav strongman and former president of Serbia, whose policies triggered the region’s descent into bloodthirsty genocide. The protests paved the way to Milošević eventually being toppled in 2000.

“These students were children when Vučić became president eight years ago and they want democracy. It’s been building up … this is the moment just before the balloon is pricked by the needle. It has caught [the government] unaware.”

On Friday, as hundreds of students reached Novi Sad on foot after a two-day, 80km trek from Belgrade, Vučić, addressing the protests, told the nation: “Our country is under attack, from abroad and from inside,” echoing earlier claims that the protesters were working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government.

The ruling Serbian Progressive party has tried to defuse the situation by releasing classified documents about the railway station’s collapse and has even gone so far as to say it will meet all the students’ demands. This week, in what was seen as a first victory, Vučić’s close ally, prime minister Miloš Vučević, resigned but few believe the protests are about to fizzle out.

With youth unemployment at record levels and graduates forced in ever growing numbers to move abroad in search of work, there is a growing sense among young Serbs that there is little to lose.

To defy government crackdowns, the students have deliberately avoided being associated with a leadership of any sort, ensuring that decisions are taken in concert in plenary sessions.

“We are not choosing violence and for now the government is not choosing violence either,” Bagarić said at the protests in Novi Sad.

As the protests swelled, Srđan Milivojević, who leads the opposition Democratic party, said it was clear Serbia’s young demonstrators were now dicta"

Thousands of Serbians blocked the main boulevard of the central city Kragujevac on Saturday, the latest in a series of student-led protests to rock the Balkan country after the deadly collapse of a train station roof.

Crowds gathered in the city's centre on the start of Serbia's national Statehood holiday calling for greater government accountability and reforms.

Protesters filled the streets well into the afternoon, waving flags marked with bloody handprints -- the protests' logo -- as they organised performances and shouted ""pump"", indicating that they are not giving up.

The university student-led movement has put increasing pressure on Serbia's government, spurring the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including prime minister Milos Vucevic at the end of January.

The collapse of the station roof in Novi Sad in November last year, which killed 15 people, followed extensive renovations to the building in the northern city and fuelled long-standing anger over corruption and demands for accountability.

The Kragujevac blockade is the third day-long city demonstration, after Belgrade and Novi Sad a few weeks ago.

At 10:52 GMT, the time of the tragedy, protesters observed 15 minutes of silence to honour the victims.

In one part of the boulevard, 15 chairs with the names and year of birth of the victims were placed where citizens laid flowers, while climbers hung a banner on the top of a 15-storey building saying: 15 lives, 15 hours of protest, 15 weeks without accountability.

The blockade is planned to last past midnight, also marking the anniversary of the first Serbian Constitution in 1835, one of the most progressive in Europe at the time, with students calling on institutions to uphold constitutional principles.

Support from professors

Belgrade chemistry student Nikola Knezevic, 25, said it was important to hold protests beyond the capital.

""To show not only Belgrade, but all these cities that support our demands, and that we support them. That is the message,"" Knezevic said.

Dragana Mitic, 55, a professor from the same faculty, hailed the students for ""fighting against corruption"".

""They have rekindled my hope. We tried 25 years ago, but the system deceived us. Now we hope that won't happen,"" he told AFP.

To quell the months-long protests, the government has sought to meet several of the students' demands.

President Aleksandar Vucic, at a rally in the northern town of Sremska Mitrovica, told thousands of his supporters the country was being attacked from the outside ""helped by many inside who manipulate our children"".

He urged the protesters to engage in dialogue and to listen to him.

""Declare victory, you have had all your demands met, return to your benches,"" he said.

""That would be best you have done for your parents, for your country, but also for yourselves, and for your future families.""

They were welcomed with fireworks, whistles and vuvuzelas, and chants of ""Bravo"" and ""Serbia has risen"".

""We are sending a message that this is a meeting with the people, with history and with the future that we are now building,"" Milica Pavlovic, a 20-year-old electrical engineering student told AFP after completing the 130-kilometre route (80-mile) route from Belgrade.

"Serbia's striking students, president hold parallel rallies - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-striking-students-president-hold-parallel-rallies/7976209.html,Voice of America,2025-02-15,"Serbia’s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic were holding parallel rallies Saturday as both marked the country's Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages.

The student-led protest is the latest in a nationwide anti-graft movement that reflects mounting calls for fundamental political changes in the Balkan state, triggered after a concrete canopy on a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1, killing 15 people.

The rally in the central industrial city of Kragujevac drew tens of thousands of people demanding justice over the accident and respect for the rule of law. The movement has been seeking to root out rampant endemic corruption.

Students chose Kragujevac for Saturday's rally because of its history. In 1835, Serbia was still part of the Ottoman Empire, and people in Kragujevac announced a new constitution that sought to limit the powers of the then-rulers. The date is now celebrated as Statehood Day.

People from all over the country streamed into Kragujevac for Saturday’s gathering.

“I am here to support this student rebellion, which has grown into a civil rebellion, and to fight for the rule of law and justice in this society, so that Serbia becomes a country where life is dignified,” said a woman from Belgrade who identified herself only by the name Teodora.

The students arrived Friday to cheers from the residents. Ahead of the protest, they organized marches in various parts of the country, encouraging people to converge in Kragujevac. Some walked; others ran or cycled. Along their journey, people greeted them with food and refreshments and offered accommodation, many crying and expressing hope for change.

The president's rally

Meanwhile, in Sremska Mitrovica, a small town northwest of Belgrade, Vucic is expected to recycle a traditional nationalist theme, warning that the West wants to unseat him by force and that this could lead to the breakup of the country.

Serbian authorities were set to bus in thousands of supporters from throughout the country as well as neighboring Bosnia. Some opposition activists have said they will try to prevent their arrival.

Vucic said on Instagram that his supporters wish to “defend and save Serbia from those who want to destroy it.”

The anti-graft movement is Vucic's biggest challenge in recent years. The president — who has ruled Serbia with a firm grip on power for more than a decade — and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been previously accused of stifling democratic freedoms, publicly discrediting opponents and rigging elections, according to international vote observers.

The canopy disaster, widely believed to have happened due to government corruption, has become a flashpoint for wider discontent with the authoritarian rule, with university students at the forefront of the anti-graft uprising. Their determination, youth and creativity have struck a chord among people widely disillusioned with politicians.

Prosecutors have charged 13 people over the canopy fall, and protests have forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister. But students have said their protests will continue until their demands for full accountability are met.

In the past three months, the president has shifted between accusing the students of working for foreign powers to offering concessions and claiming he has fulfilled each of their demands. But during a trip to the Serb-controlled part of neighboring Bosnia this week, Vucic has reiterated claims about an alleged plot from abroad to overthrow him and his government.

The authorities, Vucic said, “couldn’t believe how much money has been invested to bring down the government in Serbia.” He offered no proof for the claims.

Vucic's trip to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia was apparently designed to stress Serbian unity with the Serbs in Bosnia, where a bid to create a pan-Serb state in the 1990s’ was widely blamed for triggering a bloody war that killed more than 100,000 people killed and displaced millions."
Thousands mark Statehood Day of Serbia with anticorruption protest - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/2/16/thousands-mark-statehood-day-of-serbia-with-anticorruption-protest,Al Jazeera English,2025-02-16,"Thousands of Serbians blocked the main boulevard of the central city Kragujevac, the latest in a series of student-led protests over last November’s deadly collapse of a train station roof.

The increasing pressure being applied by the university student-led movement has already forced the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, at the end of January.

Crowds gathered in the city centre at the start of Serbia’s statehood holiday, calling for greater government accountability and reforms.

Protesters filled the streets well into the afternoon on Saturday, waving flags marked with bloody handprints – the protests’ logo.

The Kragujevac blockade is the third daylong city demonstration after Belgrade and Novi Sad a few weeks ago.

The collapse of the station roof in Novi Sad in November last year, which killed 15 people, followed extensive renovations to the building in the northern city.

The deaths fuelled longstanding anger over corruption and demands for accountability.

At 10:52 GMT, the time of the tragedy, protesters observed 15 minutes of silence to honour the victims.

The blockade was planned to last past midnight, marking the anniversary of the enactment of the Serbian Constitution in 1835, making it one of the most progressive in Europe at the time.

President Aleksandar Vucic, at a rally in the northern town of Sremska Mitrovica, told thousands of supporters the country was being attacked from the outside, “helped by many inside who manipulate our children”.

He urged the protesters to engage in dialogue and to listen to him.

“Declare victory, you have had all your demands met, return to your benches,” he said.

The government has already tried to meet some of the students’ demands in a bid to quell the months-long protests.

The students in Kragujevac however are continuing to call for greater transparency.

In advance of the rally, hundreds of students from Novi Sad, Belgrade and the southern city of Nis staged a four-day march that converged on Friday night on Kragujevac’s centre."

Serbia's students lead tens of thousands calling for change - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-graft-protesters-march-block-bridges-in-serbia/7959835.html,Voice of America,2025-02-01,"Serbia's students led a mass protest and blocked bridges over the River Danube in the northern city of Novi Sad on Saturday, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to express their anger with the country's populist leadership and to call for change.

Saturday marked three months since a huge concrete canopy at Novi Sad's main railway station collapsed, killing 15 people. The crash on November 1 sparked a wide anti-corruption movement and months of student-led street protests.

Many in Serbia believe that the collapse was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies.

Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, poor oversight and disrespect of existing safety regulations. The issue has come to symbolize a wider discontent over the rule of law in Serbia.

Tens of thousands of people converged on Novi Sad for the blockades, dubbed ""Three Months — Three Bridges."" One of the blockades is set to extend until Sunday.

As the blockades started, entire bridges and the streets around them were flooded with people, while many more stood on the riverbanks below. Self-appointed student guards had to control the number of people walking on the bridges for security reasons.

""After long time we can feel positive energy in the air, on the streets, among people,"" said Slavica Nikolic, a resident.

""When I talk to people, it feels like the hope has woken up,"" she said. ""We remember well some uglier times. This is finally some sort of new hope, that something good is going to happen in this country.""

Roads into the city were clogged with cars ahead of the rally as people tried to reach Novi Sad from Belgrade and other Serbian cities.

Tractors rolled through the city streets as farmers drove in front of three separate student columns heading toward the three bridges and thousands of residents cheered them along the way. Many carried Serbian flags in the crowd or banners reading ""Three months"" or ""We are defending freedom.""

University students have taken a leading role in the protests that have developed into the most serious challenge in years to the country's powerful populist leader, President Aleksandar Vucic.

Vucic has accused students and other protesters of working for foreign intelligence services to oust him from power, while at the same time offering concessions and talks and issuing veiled threats by saying that his supporters' ""patience is running out.""

""Today we offer talks and today we offer dialogue,"" Vucic said Saturday. ""The second someone thinks that they will use violence to seize power, the state will act like a state, just like everywhere else in the world.""

Persistent demonstrations forced the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic earlier this week and various concessions from the populist government as it seeks to quell growing resistance.

Thousands of people came out Friday evening to welcome hundreds of students from Belgrade who had walked for two days to join the bridge blockades.

Apart from Novi Sad and Belgrade, daily protests and traffic blockades have been held throughout Serbia, often marred by incidents, including drivers ramming cars into protesters.

One such incident happened in Belgrade on Friday, leaving two women injured after a driver knocked them down.

Along the way on their 80-kilometer (50-mile) journey to Novi Sad on Thursday and Friday, the students from Belgrade were greeted by cheering citizens who honked their car horns or came out of their homes to offer food and drinks.

Hundreds more on bicycles and motorcycles headed separately toward Novi Sad on Friday and Saturday while Belgrade's taxi drivers said they would come and give the marchers a lift home Sunday."

The demonstration was the latest in a series of mass protests to rock the Balkan country in the wake of the roof cave-in that killed 15 people in the northern Serbian city in November.

The university student-led movement has put increasing pressure on the government of the Balkan country, spurring the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including that of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic earlier this week.

The premier's resignation came after a 24-hour blockade at a major traffic intersection in the capital Belgrade.

It was preceded days before by a general strike that saw schools and small businesses close across the country.

The collapse of the station roof in Novi Sad followed extensive renovations to the building.

The accident fuelled long-standing anger in Serbia over corruption and the alleged lack of oversight in construction projects.

""There is no turning back, no fear, and we will not give up,"" Jelena Vuksanovic, a philosophy student in Novi Sad, told AFP as protesters converged on downtown Novi Sad for the hours-long rally.

Ahead of the demonstration, traffic entering Novi Sad remained heavily congested with a long line waiting to pass through tolls to reach the city.

As the protest kicked off, tens of thousands marched through Novi Sad's streets waving flags and signs as they chanted anti-corruption slogans, while blocking roads and occupying the city's three main bridges.

Student led

University students have emerged as the leaders of the protest movement and have been blockading campuses across the country for weeks.

President Aleksandar Vucic and other government officials have swung between issuing calls for talks and firing off allegations that the demonstrators are being backed by foreign powers.

To quell the protests, the government has sought to meet several of the student organisers' demands.

Those measures have included releasing a raft of documents related to the renovations at the station; pardoning protesters arrested at rallies; boosting funding for higher education; and launching criminal proceedings against suspects accused of attacking demonstrators.

But Bojan Klacar -- the director of CeSID, an organisation monitoring elections in Serbia -- said meeting many of the protesters' demands might not be enough to satisfy the students.

""It has become a broader movement where deeper, systemic changes are being demanded,"" Klacar told AFP.

Ahead of Saturday's rally, hundreds of students left Belgrade on Thursday for a two-day march to Novi Sad.

They have been greeted by residents in villages and towns along the 80-kilometre (50-mile) route.

""I am walking to pay tribute to all the victims of the great tragedy that took place in Novi Sad,"" one student told AFP as the students departed Belgrade.

""You only see this once in your life,"" Dalibor Mitrovic, 45, told AFP, as he watched the students arrive in the city.

Tensions have flared occasionally in recent weeks, with violence breaking out at some protests. Students have accused pro-government hooligans of targeting demonstrations.

‘We’ve proved that change is possible’ – but Serbia protesters unsure of next move - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/03/serbia-student-led-protesters-next-move,The Guardian,2025-02-03,"When Serbian protesters took over the town of Novi Sad this weekend and staged a triumphant street festival, occasional chants could be heard of an old slogan dating back a quarter of a century.

“Gotov je!” (“He’s finished!”) was the mantra of the 2000 revolt that brought down Serbia’s post-communist dictator Slobodan Milošević. This time it was aimed at his successor, President Aleksandar Vučić, but the chant did not travel far among the tens of thousands gathered in Novi Sad.

The words were from another era and the students who have led the past three months of protests have no real interest in a change of leadership, arguing they have no confidence that the existing political system would produce anyone better. They are not pointing out the emperor has no clothes, they say, only to end up with a new emperor.

“We need to rebuild everything from scratch,” said Ana Ðurović, a film-making student, standing in the midst of a dense, jubilant crowd on one of the three bridges across the Danube blocked by protesters as evening fell on Saturday. “Students are not trying to participate in politics or government. That’s not the plan.”

1:01 Tens of thousands rally against Serbian government in student-led protests – video report

With the students reluctant to get involved in conventional politics against a well-entrenched regime, there is a troubling question hanging over the euphoria of the protests: now what?

Serbian democrats have reason to be cautious. Milošević’s democratic successor, Zoran Đinđić, held office as prime minister for little more than two years before being shot through the heart by a sniper, a special forces veteran taking orders from organised crime.

The trigger for the latest protests has been more bloodshed: the lives of 15 people lost when the canopy roof outside Novi Sad railway station collapsed on 1 November, amid evidence of slipshod construction, fraud and corruption.

For the protesters there is a common strand: what is rotten in Serbia’s body politic has once again ended up killing its own citizens. The emblem of the protests has become a scarlet palm print, depicting the bloody hands of those in power.

The students’ strategy is to focus on the Novi Sad station disaster with specific demands for transparency and accountability, and their hope is their dogged insistence on those two scarce commodities will somehow change Serbia.

“If they do every single thing that students want from the government, we will have a total change in our society, because they will have to start arresting people at the top of government,” said Ivan Bjelić, an activist who has spent 23 days in jail for his part in the demonstrations.

The protests have so far wrongfooted Vučić and his Serbian Progressive party (SNS), who had grown adept over more than a decade at sidelining the conventional political opposition, through a mix of government patronage and the threats of character assassination through friendly tabloids, dismissal or financial pressure.

The students have kept their distance from the opposition parties and operate collectively through plenary meetings and direct democracy, with no identifiable leaders the government can target. And with each tabloid denunciation or sporadic physical attack, including two car-ramming incidents, the protests have grown.

“It’s really very challenging for this government, because they don’t know how to talk with these young people who are just asking for justice and for truth,” said Srdan Golubović, a celebrated Serbian film director and one of Ðurović’s professors from the University of Belgrade.

Golubović and most of the dramatic arts faculty were standing with the students on one of the Novi Sad bridges on Saturday. He compared the protests to the mass uprisings of 1968, in their student leadership, the emphasis on direct democracy and systemic change, as well as their sheer scale.

“This started as something small but it has become a big wave, as many people from all the cities and small towns in Serbia are no longer afraid. That’s the most important thing – the loss of fear,” Golubović said.

The students’ broadening base of support was evident over a sunlit weekend in Novi Sad. Local farmers brought dozens of tractors, deployed as brightly coloured steel guardians on the bridges and city streets. Serbia’s biker community arrived on thousands of motorcycles that entered in dramatic style on Saturday afternoon, in one long cavalcade escorted by smiling police. Meanwhile, army veterans marched in their crimson berets through the city centre to pay their respects at the damaged railway station.

Kosovo prime minister looking for allies for new Cabinet after failing to win parliament majority - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-prime-minister-looking-for-allies-for-a-new-cabinet-after-failing-to-win-parliament-majority-/7969195.html,Voice of America,2025-02-10,"Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s leftwing party won most seats in the weekend parliamentary election but was left without a majority in the house, forcing it to look for an ally to form the next government, according to preliminary results released Monday.

The vote on Sunday was key in determining who will lead Kosovo as talks on normalizing ties with rival Serbia remain stalled and foreign funding for one of Europe’s poorest countries is in question.

The election marked the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo’s parliament completed a full four-year mandate. It was the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence.

With 88% of the votes counted, Kurti’s Self-Determination Movement Party, or Vetevendosje!, had won 41.3%, according to the Central Election Commission, the election governing body.

The Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are detained at a Netherlands-based international criminal tribunal in The Hague and accused of war crimes, won 21.8% of the vote.

Next, with 17.8% support is the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country. The LDK lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The Alliance for Kosovo’s Future of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj garnered 7.7% of the votes.

Still, Kurti was upbeat, though his remarks gave nothing away about who he plans to ask to join his coalition government.

“The people won. Vetevendosje! won. We are the winners who will form the next Cabinet,” Kurti told journalists as his supporters took to the streets to celebrate.

The commission’s webpage was down temporarily on Sunday as it was overloaded “due to the citizens’ high interest to learn the results,” election body said. Results were collected manually.

A preliminary turnout after 92% of the votes counted was 40.6% — about 7% lower than four years ago.

The new 120-seat parliament reserves 20 seats for minorities regardless of election results, 10 of them for the Serb minority.

Kurti’s new term will face multiple challenges after Washington recently announced it was freezing foreign aid and the European Union, almost two years ago, suspended funding for some projects and initiatives. He also is under pressure to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty.

Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than $6,000 per person.

Kurti also is likely to try and repair ties with Western powers, at odds since his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency, the dinar, and dinar transfers to Kosovo's Serbs.

Kosovo’s ethnic Serb minority depends on Belgrade’s social services and payments.

The United States, the European Union and the NATO-led stabilization force in Kosovo, or KFOR, have urged the government in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict.

In Sunday's election, Srpska Lista, the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, won 2.8% of the vote — just over half of its winnings four years ago.

The party's leader, Zlatan Elek, said it was “the absolute winner of this election,” and thanked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic for the “strong support for our people.”

KFOR had increased its presence in Kosovo after last year’s tensions with Serbia, as well as ahead of the election.

A team of 104 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations, monitored the vote."

Why Kosovo's Election Matters For The Region And The World - Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty,https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-elections-albin-kurti-serbia/33307113.html,Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty,2025-02-08,"For Kosovo, the February 9 parliamentary elections are about much more than just choosing a new government; they will shape the country’s diplomatic future, regional stability, and international standing.

And, according to experts in the United States and the EU, the stakes are high -- without alignment with its international allies, Kosovo risks not only diplomatic friction but also potential isolation or even a frozen conflict.

Kosovo's relations with Washington and Brussels are centered around the EU-facilitated dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, which began in 2011 and aims to normalize relations between the two countries.

Kurti Takes A Hard Line

Since Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, which Serbia still rejects, there have been ongoing tensions between the two countries.

These tensions primarily revolve around ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, who reject Pristina's authority and have tried to maintain parallel governance structures with Belgrade's support.

Over the past 2 1/2 years, the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti -- which is likely to win reelection -- has taken a hard line, replacing Serbian license plates with Kosovar ones, stopping the import of the Serbian currency to Kosovo, and closing Serbian banks and dozens of parallel institutions.

Kurti's moves have been criticized by the previous U.S. administration and the EU, who argued that they were not coordinated with Kosovo's international partners and have made life harder for the country's ethnic Serbs.

Richard Grenell, who served as special envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo talks in U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration, wrote on X that the ""Kurti Government was not trustworthy during Trump's first term, nor during Biden's term."" According to Grenell, both ""Republicans and Democrats have criticized Kurti consistently for taking unilateral actions that destabilize the region.""

Kurti, however, has stuck to his guns, even when warned by the United States or when, in June 2023, the EU suspended financial aid to the country worth up to 100 million euros ($104 million).

The moves against Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, Kurti has said, were necessary steps aimed at extending the rule of law in the north of the country, where most of Kosovo's ethnic Serbs live, and in line with the country's constitution. Moreover, on February 2, he said that no Kosovar government has had better relations with the United States than his own.

Kosovo’s elections will also shape its relationship with the EU, which is closely tied to its diplomatic stance toward Serbia.

Kosovo’s EU application, which was submitted in December 2022, has been stalled ever since, as it needs a consensus of support among the 27 members of the EU. The biggest hurdle is the five EU countries -- Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain -- that do not recognize Kosovo's independence.

Toby Vogel, a Western Balkans analyst at the Berlin-based Democratization Policy Council, told RFE/RL that Kosovo's next government will need to work more diligently to improve relations with the EU.

There is also the question of Kosovo's membership in international organizations, such as Interpol or the Council of Europe. While the EU has promised backing for Pristina to join these bodies, Serbian efforts to counteract have always succeeded.

Will Kurti Change?

Kurti's ruling Self-Determination Movement (LVV) is currently the favorite to win the elections, although most polls are predicting the party won't reach the 50 percent needed to form a government on its own.

And, so far, Kurti has shown little sign that he is ready to change his policy toward Serbia and the West.

The Kosovar government has continued to take a hard line by continuing to close institutions in the country tied to Serbia. And Kurti has signaled that, if he wins a new mandate as prime minister, he will continue to strengthen his image as an uncompromising leader who prioritizes principle over diplomacy.

""The Republic of Kosovo, with our government in charge, will never say yes to the 'Association,'"" Kurti said at a rally with supporters in South Mitrovica on February 1.

The association Kurti was referring is the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities in Kosovo, which was part of an agreement Kosovo reached with Serbia in 2013 but has never been implemented.

A huge sticking point between Serbia and Kosovo, the association is intended to coordinate Serb-majority municipalities in areas such as education, health care, and economic development.

If Kurti wins and sticks to his guns, it could mean Kosovo is more isolated than ever.

This, Vogel suggested, could mean occasional violence or a frozen conflict, ""like the one that's developed in Cyprus...over the years."" ""That would be a real problem for Kosovo,"" he said, ""because that would make it impossible for the country to move on.""

Opposition Win Could Bring Significant Change

There is also the possibility that Kurti would lose. If the LVV"
Claims about USAID funding are spreading online. Many are not based on facts - Detroit News,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/07/claims-about-usaid-funding-are-spreading-online-many-are-not-based-on-facts/78340829007/,Detroit News,2025-02-07,"Melissa Goldin

Associated Press

As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, false and misleading information is being pushed on social media to support the change, much of it spread by the administration and Elon Musk.

The posts raise questions about funding for certain projects and organizations, often claiming without evidence that the money was used inappropriately.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said to reporters Tuesday that USAID had spent “$1.5 million to advance DEI in Serbia’s workplaces; 70,000 for the production of a DEI musical in Ireland; 47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia, 32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru.” Those claims were picked up and spread widely on social media throughout the week.

Only the grant to a Serbian organization called Grupa Izadji was awarded by USAID. Its stated aim is to “to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities.”

The rest were awarded by the State Department's Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. In 2022, it granted $70,884 to an Irish company for “a live musical event to promote the U.S. and Irish shared values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.” A grant for $25,000 was awarded in 2021 to a university in Colombia “to raise awareness and increase the transgender representation” through the production of an opera, with an additional $22,020 coming from non-federal funding. And $32,000 awarded in 2022 to a Peruvian organization funded “a tailored-made comic, featuring an LGBTQ+ hero to address social and mental health issues.""

“The information environment about what USAID does and does not do has gotten to a very difficult place, where there's a lot of false and misleading information being circulated,” said Rachel Bonnifield, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. “And I would hope everybody could hew back to the facts, which are publicly available, and we can have a good faith discussion about what USAID should and should not be doing based on those.”

Sean Roberts, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University and director of the school’s international development studies master’s program, explained that it “makes sense” that these programs were funded by the under secretary’s office.

“They do these small grant programs as outreach to local organizations and local communities and they’re generally supposed to reflect values of the United States and the friendship between the countries,” he said. “Sometimes they’re about democracy, in this case they’re about diversity. But they have nothing to do with USAID.”

Asked about the Trump administration's portrayal of USAID funding, including Leavitt's statement earlier this week, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said, “This waste of taxpayer dollars underscores why the president paused foreign aid on day one to ensure it aligns with American interests.” She did not address the misrepresented grants cited above.

What about the media?

Major media outlets are among the organizations that have been singled out with claims that are false and misleading, including The Associated Press.

The BBC, for example, was said to have received approximately $3.2 million (2.6 million pounds) during the 2023-2024 financial year. But that money didn’t go to its news operation. It went to BBC Media Action, an international charity that is “part of the BBC family,” but editorially and financially separate from BBC News, the charity said in a statement. It accounted for about 8% of BBC Media Action’s budget that year.

“We follow the BBC’s editorial standards and values in our support for public interest media,” reads the statement. “However, all of our funding goes to our own projects. These are completely separate from the journalism of BBC News. We have no influence over the editorial decision-making of BBC News. The BBC in the UK is mostly funded by a TV Licence fee.”

The BBC – not including BBC Media Action, which is a separate entity – also earns income from the organization’s commercial subsidiaries.

Posts shared widely across social media also falsely claimed that Politico received at least $8 million from USAID in 2024, with some posts putting that number as high as $34.3 million. That is incorrect. USAID did pay the news site $44,000 in subscription fees in financial years 2023 and 2024. But additional government payments came from other entities.

Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.

The Associated Press was among the media outlets said to receive USAID funding. Although the news wire has been paid $37.5 million by other government agencies since 2008, none of thatcame from USAID, according to a federal government website that tracks its spending.

Serbia is facing its largest-ever protest movement – why is Europe looking away? - The Conversation Indonesia,https://theconversation.com/serbia-is-facing-its-largest-ever-protest-movement-why-is-europe-looking-away-249388,The Conversation Indonesia,2025-02-14,"On November 1 2024, the roof of a newly €55 million renovated railway station in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second biggest city, collapsed and killed 15 people. The deaths sparked Serbia’s largest wave of student-led anti-government protests since Yugoslavia’s disintegration in 2000.

The protests pose the most serious threat to Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić’s power since he became prime minister in 2014, and president in 2017. The protest movement has highlighted Vučić’s growing authoritarian rule and widespread corruption in Serbia.

Serbians believe that the deadly roof collapse was caused by government corruption. The station was renovated by a Chinese-led consortium as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative investments and growing political ties with Serbia. The Chinese consortium and Vučić refused to publish the railway station restoration procurement contract after protesters demanded it.

The protesters have four demands: the publication of all procurement documents concerning the renovation of the station, a stop to the prosecution of students arrested during the protests, the prosecution of police and security forces involved in attacking students during the protests and a 20% increase in the budget for higher education.

However, the Serbian government and media — most of which Vučić controls through a network of political patronage and cronyism – are downplaying the protests and threatening students.

Vučić claims that foreign powers are behind the protests to topple him and destabilise Serbia. Russia and China have fully supported Vučić’s claims that Serbia is the target of a western plot to orchestrate the protesters and overthrow Vučić.

Serbia’s history of corruption

In the decade after former president Slobodan Milošević was overthrown, Serbia implemented a number of democratic and anti-corruption reforms. As a result, the country climbed to 72nd place out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index in 2013. Serbia opened EU membership negotiations the following year.

However, since Vučić took office, Serbia has become more authoritarian. Corruption is widespread, and the government has exploited tensions and instability with most of its western Balkans neighbours, primarily Kosovo, for political gain.

Serbia was downgraded to partly free by Freedom House in 2019, and the V-Dem Institute (Varieties of Democracy) labelled it as as an “electoral autocracy”. Serbia dropped to 105th place in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index in 2024.

Many international organisations monitoring anti-corruption, human rights and democracy have reported Vučić’s authoritarian tendencies and corruption in Serbia.

A report from Amnesty International published in December 2024 describes Serbia as a “digital prison”. It has been reported that Serbian authorities are using surveillance technology to monitor and suppress the protesters and other political opponents.

International response

The EU has mostly stayed silent since the protests began. After receiving letters from NGOs and activists, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos stated that the EU is following the protests in Serbia, and backed the rule of law and freedom of assembly.

This is a far cry from the EU’s response to protests in Georgia last year. EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen said “the Georgian people are fighting for democracy” – yet has stayed silent on the protests in Serbia.

Some argue this (lack of) response is because in August 2024, Vučić made a deal with the EU to provide lithium to the bloc – a boon to the EU’s electric vehicle production. There were also widespread protests against the lithium deal over its transparency and concerns that the mine would cause irreversible environmental destruction to Serbia’s Jadar Valley.

The US has also stayed quiet. President Donald Trump’s associates were recently granted permission to build a Trump hotel in Belgrade. Further, Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois who served eight years in prison for corruption, is being considered as the new US ambassador to Serbia. Blagojevich, whose father is from Serbia, expressed support for Vučić and visited the country.

What is next for Serbia?

Serbia’s prime minister, Miloš Vučević, and Novi Sad’s mayor, Milan Đurić, both resigned in an effort to de-escalate the protests. Following the resignation of the PM, Vučić has said that he is open to the new government making the documents about the station collapse public.

While this may be a sign that the protests are loosening Vučić’s grip, the movement has only intensified, spreading to more than 200 towns on February 1.

Vučić has pledged to either form a new government within one month, or organise a new parliamentary election in the spring to address the protesters’ demands. However, this would barely paper over the cracks of systemic corruption in Serbia.

PM Albin Kurti declares victory in Kosovo election - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/9/kosovo-votes-in-election-seen-as-referendum-on-pm-albin-kurti,Al Jazeera English,2025-02-09,"The vote will determine who leads Kosovo’s stalled normalisation talks with neighbouring Serbia.

Prime Minister Albin Kurti has declared victory in Kosovo’s parliamentary election, but the results mean he must now try to form a coalition government.

Preliminary results released late on Sunday showed the premier’s leftist Vetevendosje party in first place with 41.99 percent. The vote was widely viewed as a referendum on Kurti, who has been at odds with his Western allies over relations with neighbouring Serbia.

With 73 percent of votes counted, the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo was set to come second with 22.68 percent of the vote. The Democratic League of Kosovo took 17.9 percent.

The results leave Kurti needing partners in order to govern. He had previously said he would not take part in a coalition, but appeared to walk that back.

“We are the first party, the winning party that will create the next government,” he told reporters. “We will continue to finish the work that we have started.”

Al Jazeera’s Maja Blazevska, reporting from Pristina, said “Kosovo will go back to having a coalition government.”

Serbia dominates

Kosovars had headed to the polling stations on Sunday to elect a new parliament and cabinet in a contentious race that also focused on the economy and corruption, although relations with Serbia have long been the biggest issue in the country’s political debate.

It was the ninth parliamentary vote since the end of the 1998-99 war that pushed Serbian forces out of the self-declared republic.

A key test for Kurti, the vote will elect 120 legislators to the assembly, determining who leads Kosovo’s stalled negotiations on normalising ties with Belgrade.

Kurti’s left-wing Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination Movement party, which has sought to dismantle remaining Serbian institutions in Kosovo, was the frontrunner. But the party must now seek cooperation to form a cabinet.

The candidates include the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), whose main leaders are accused of war crimes at The Hague tribunal, and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), the republic’s oldest party.

Another is the Alliance for Kosovo’s Future of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, which won 7.5 percent of the vote.

The opposition parties have made big-ticket pledges to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and healthcare services and fight poverty.

Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is among the poorest in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than 6,000 euros ($6,200) per person.

‘Critical for Kosovo’s future’

Kurti, whose government is the first in Kosovo’s history to finish its full term in office, has had a turbulent rule, marked by regular unrest between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.

Tensions spiked after negotiations backed by the European Union and the United States between Kosovo and Serbia all but collapsed in March 2023.

In the aftermath, NATO peacekeepers were assaulted by rioting Serbs, a deadly armed standoff in the north sent regional tensions soaring, and an explosion targeting a canal vital to Kosovo’s power plants late last year saw Kurti blaming Belgrade.

Kurti also drew Western criticism for controversial measures he took last year, such as a ban on using the Serbian dinar and transfers from Serbia to Kosovo’s ethnic Serb minority members who depend on Belgrade’s social services and payments.

The US, the EU and the NATO-led stabilisation force KFOR have urged the government in Pristina to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of interethnic conflict.

While Kurti retains a strong support base, his opponents have denounced him for the fraying ties with the US and the EU.

Shpend Kursani, a lecturer at the University of Tartu told Al Jazeera that voters most identify Kurti with “anti-corruption, national dignity and being – at least from a Balkan perspective – an honest politician”.

Opposition parties, however, blame Kurti’s willingness to confront Serbia as costing the country support and funding from the international community, even as he was able to secure the sale of antitank Javelin missiles from the US, Kursani said.

“It’s the same with Turkiye; he purchased drones and what not, so the support from international communities is a bit mixed,” Kursani said. “He’s largely not corrupt… and it’s very difficult [for outside powers] to manage these small country leaders if they are not corrupt.”

KFOR has increased its presence in Kosovo and added more forces for the election. A team of 100 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe, and about 1,600 others from international or local organisations will also monitor the vote."

To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

The last voters cast their ballots in Kosovo Sunday in elections pitting combative incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti's quest to stamp out Serbian influence against a fractured opposition's vow to boost the economy.

Kurti and his Vetevendosje (""Self-Determination"") party (VV) have campaigned on their efforts to dismantle the remaining Serbian institutions in Kosovo while expanding the government's reach to Serb-majority areas.

He and the VV insist his government is in greater control of Kosovo's territory than at any other time since independence.

""I thank all the citizens of Kosovo who voted so far and encourage everybody to vote,"" said Kurti as voting got under way across Kosovo.

Polls closed at 7:00 pm (1800 GMT).

A projection published by leading Kosovo news outlet KOHA said VV was leading the race with an estimated 42 percent of votes cast for the incumbent party.

The right-wing Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) trailed in second with 21 percent followed by the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) with 20 percent.

Shadow state

Animosity between Kosovo and Serbia has persisted since the war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents in the late 1990s.

Serbia has steadfastly refused to acknowledge Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008.

To curb Belgrade's influence, Kosovo's authorities have effectively outlawed the use of the Serbian dinar, closed banks and shuttered the post offices where Serbian pension payments were cashed.

Belgrade-backed government and tax offices have also been closed and Serbian car number plates banned.

The moves have heightened the uneasy relations between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority and its Serb minority in the run-up to the polls.

Once known for antagonistic stunts such as letting off tear gas in parliament, the VV has grown from a street movement led by Kurti in the 2000s to Kosovo's dominant political party.

Kurti's government is the first to finish its full term in office since the breakaway Serbian province declared independence.

But Kurti's rule has been turbulent.

Tensions spiked after EU- and US-backed negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia all but collapsed in March 2023.

In the aftermath, NATO peacekeepers were assaulted by rioting Serbs, a deadly armed standoff in the north sent regional tensions soaring and an explosion targeting a canal vital to Kosovo's power plants late last year saw Kurti blaming Belgrade.

Throughout the unrest, Kurti has remained unwavering, even if it meant running afoul of Kosovo's vital allies in the United States and Europe.

But his supporters have praised his vision.

""You can see the things (Kurti) has done. He is irreplaceable,"" Zek Kurtaj, 40, told AFP after landing at the Pristina airport on Saturday ahead of the vote.

'Missing out'

Others suggest Kurti's actions may have been overly disruptive.

Kurti ""has been repeatedly accused by opposition parties of delivering little, defying the international community, and complaining about Serbia while missing out on opportunities to build infrastructure and develop Kosovo economically,"" wrote Jonathan Moore, an analyst from the Atlantic Council's Europe Center.

Several of Kurti's rivals -- which include more than two dozen opposition parties in the contest -- have sought to focus on Kosovo's economic uncertainty.

Kosovo remains one of the poorest economies in Europe, with roughly 12 percent of its population emigrating since 2011.

Many voters said economic issues were at the top of their minds as they cast their ballots.

""We believe that change will come. I am thinking about employment, the economy, and all other sectors,"" Remzije Halimi, a teacher, told AFP.

In the run up to the vote, PDK leading figure Xhavit Haliti -- considered one of the VV's strongest opponents -- has slammed Kurti for fraying ties with Washington and Brussels.

Meanwhile, the LDK led by economist Lumir Abdixhiku has vowed to increase salaries and boost pensions.

In ethnic Serb areas, the Belgrade-backed Serb List party has campaigned on familiar vows to protect the rights of Kosovo's dwindling Serb minority.

""Any Serb who does not vote... or who votes against the Serb List de facto gives their vote to Kurti and to those who obey him,"" party leader Zlatan Elek told local media before the vote.

Serb voters in the northern city of Mitrovica said they hoped elections would bring more prosperity in the future after years of tensions.

""The situation is now so bad that it can only be better,"" said Serb resident Dragisa, who only provided his first name.

Serbia: Protect journalists amidst nationwide protests - PEN International,https://www.pen-international.org/news/serbia-protect-journalists-amidst-nationwide-protests,PEN International,2025-02-07,"“Once again, independent journalists seeking to inform on nationwide protests in Serbia are the target of the Serbian authorities as well as pro-government media and trolls, who not only prevent them from reporting but vilify them through hateful statements and manipulated videos. We stand with the courageous journalists of Serbia and urge the authorities to ensure their safety” - Ma Thida, Chair of PEN International’s Writers in Prison Committee

07 February 2025: The Serbian authorities must uphold the right to peacefully protest and ensure a safe and enabling environment for journalists, PEN International said today, as student-led demonstrations continue to sweep through the country.

The trigger for the latest protests came on 1 November 2024, when 15 people died and several were seriously injured following the collapse of the concrete canopy of the newly renovated train station in Novi Sad, northern Serbia. Many blamed the Serbian authorities for the disaster, alleging corruption and incompetence. Since then, tens of thousands of people have been taking part in student-led demonstrations across the country, urging transparency and accountability. Serbia’s transport minister and prime minister subsequently resigned, with the protests showing no sign of abating. On 3 February 2025, Serbia’s Bar Association declared a one-month lawyers’ strike in solidarity, bringing the justice system to a halt.

Protesters have alleged that pro-government groups have been seeking to escalate violence during the largely peaceful protests, in an effort to disrupt and undermine them. Pro-government media have been reporting negatively on the protests and published some protesters’ personal data, raising concerns for their safety. Notably, in January 2025, a showing at the University of Belgrade of Oliver Frljić’s play Zoran Đinđić – based on the late Serbian prime minister assassinated in 2003 because of his pro-democracy stance and crackdown on organised crime – was demonised on social media and portrayed by tabloids as yet another example of students offending and betraying Serbia. President Aleksandar Vučić alleged students were receiving money from abroad and accused foreign media of lying about the protests.

Journalists in Serbia have been prevented from reporting on the protests and vilified by pro-government media. Amongst those targeted is Serbian broadcaster and journalist Zoran Kesić, who reported at least 200 threatening graffiti across Belgrade linking him to the Novi Sad tragedy, prompting a complaint by the Association of Independent Electronic Media (ANEM). The Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia (NUNS) recorded over 30 instances of attacks, verbal threats and intimidation of journalists by public officials, law enforcement officials and individuals in January 2025 alone.

An edited video, published on 3 March 2025 and widely shared on social media platforms, saw actors Marko Janketić and Mirjana Karanović, journalists Zoran Kesić, Jelena Obućina and Marko Vidojković, playwright Biljana Srbljanović and historian Milan St Protić made to appear as supporting Kosovo’s independence and branded traitors. Some featured in the video reported receiving death threats. Parliamentary elections have been scheduled for Kosovo on 9 February amid rising tension with the country’s ethnic Serbs and Serbia itself.

PEN International urges the Serbian authorities to abide by their national and international obligations to uphold the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and to ensure that journalists, writers and activists can speak out and inform without fear of reprisal.

Why the Kosovo government annoys the West and what parliamentary election will change - Європейська правда,https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/7/7204451/,Європейська правда,2025-02-07,"On 9 February, parliamentary elections in the Republic of Kosovo are set to be held.

Kosovo usually appears in international news in connection with another escalation of tensions with Serbia, a country that considers Kosovo its territory, or due to terrorist attacks and protests by ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo.

One of the key reasons for these conflicts is the policy of the current Kosovo government, led by Albin Kurti, aimed at strengthening state control over the north, where ethnic Serbs live.

The elections in Kosovo will serve as a kind of referendum on whether Kosovars support this course, even at the cost of some deterioration in relations with the West.

The issue becomes even more relevant with Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

Read more about the challenges facing Kosovo in the article by Volodymyr Tsybulnyk, a Western Balkans expert, and Yurii Panchenko, European Pravda's editor – Election at risk of ""painful compromises."" Why the vote in Kosovo matters to Ukraine.

The main contender for victory in the parliamentary elections is the Self-Determination Movement (Vetëvendosje – LVV), led by incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti.

The party and its leader maintain significant public support, as Kurti’s populism falls on fertile ground. He defends Kosovo’s independence in negotiations with Serbia and systematically implements decisions to strengthen the country’s sovereignty.

It was during his government that Kosovo obtained visa-free travel with the EU (effective from 1 January 2024) and came close to joining the Council of Europe.

Equally important, Kurti ended the operation of parallel Serbian state institutions in the Serb-majority municipalities in the north. These steps enjoy strong public support but have provoked dissatisfaction from the EU and the US.

For this reason, the deterioration of relations with strategic allies is one of the main criticisms leveled at Kurti by the opposition.

Kurti’s chances of victory are further boosted by the fact that his two main rivals, the Democratic Party of Kosovo (DPK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), are currently in weak positions.

Even another notable opposition force, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), is unlikely to gain significant traction despite its contacts with Trump’s former envoy, Richard Grenell. But who knows...

Regardless of the election outcome, the new (or returning) government will have to tackle a series of challenges.

The first and foremost is resolving the crisis in northern Kosovo.

Local Serbs (backed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić) are demanding the establishment of the Association of Serb Municipalities. The creation of this body was agreed upon in multiple deals signed by Kosovo and Serbia under EU mediation, starting with the 2013 Brussels Agreement.

This obligation, however, was undertaken before Kurti came to power and is absolutely unacceptable to him. Nonetheless, the West remains reluctant to revise the agreements.

Meanwhile, Russia is highly interested in keeping the Kosovo-Serbia deadlock unresolved. By echoing Serbian claims, the Kremlin fuels instability throughout the Western Balkans.

Such a foreign policy environment directly hinders Kosovo’s development.

Finally, Kosovo’s new government may face pressure from Donald Trump, who, during his first term, proposed a peace agreement between Kosovo and Serbia based on territorial exchange, a proposal firmly rejected by both Kosovo and the EU.

In such a scenario, a strong electoral mandate will be a crucial argument for the new government in resisting this pressure."

Thousands mark Serbian Statehood Day with anti-corruption protest - Jordan Times,https://jordantimes.com/news/world/thousands-mark-serbian-statehood-day-anti-corruption-protest,Jordan Times,2025-02-15,"KRAGUJEVAC, SERBIA — Thousands of Serbians blocked the main boulevard of the central city Kragujevac on Saturday, the latest in a series of months-long mass protests to rock the Balkan country after the deadly collapse of a train station roof.



Thousands of students and citizens from across the country gathered in the city's centre on the start of Serbia's national holiday to call for greater government accountability and reforms.



Protestors waved flags marked with bloody handprint, the protests' logo, as they organized performances and shouted ""pump"", a message indicating that they are not thinking of giving up.



The university student-led movement has put increasing pressure on Serbia's government, spurring the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including Prime Minister Milos Vucevic at the end of January.



Last November's collapse of the station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people, followed extensive renovations to the building in the northern city and fueled long-standing anger over corruption and demands for accountability.



The Kragujevac blockade is the third day-long city demonstration, after Belgrade and Novi Sad a few weeks ago.



At 10:52 AM GMT, the time of the tragedy, protesters observed 15 minutes of silence to honor the victims.



The blockade is planned to last past midnight, also marking Statehood Day and the anniversary of the first Serbian Constitution in 1835, one of the most progressive in Europe at the time, with students calling on institutions to uphold constitutional principles today.

Big challenges await the new government of Kosovo - Robert Lansing Institute,https://lansinginstitute.org/2025/02/07/big-challenges-await-the-new-government-of-kosovo/,Robert Lansing Institute,2025-02-07,"Kosovo is just days away from its first regular parliamentary elections since declaring independence in 2008. Scheduled for Sunday, February 9, the elections were set by President Vjosa Osmani. After coordination with parliamentary political parties, the Central Election Commission (CEC) certified 28 political entities and 1,280 candidates for deputy positions, all competing for a four-year term in government.

In the 2021 early parliamentary elections, the “Vetevendosje Movement,” in coalition with the party of the current president, Vjosa Osmani’s “Lista Guxo,” secured over 50% of the popular vote. As a result, Albin Kurti, leader of the Levizja Vetevendosje party, was elected Prime Minister. Initially, Kurti declared that dialogue with Serbia was not a priority for his government. However, as anticipated, engagement in dialogue became inevitable.

Despite initial reluctance, Kurti and his delegates participated in multiple meetings in Brussels with Serbian representatives, but these discussions failed to yield concrete results. This impasse led to tensions in northern Kosovo, prompting the European Union (EU) to hold the Kosovo government accountable for escalating the situation. Consequently, Kosovo faced EU sanctions, while Serbia, which has been accused of manipulating the Kosovo Serb community, went unpunished.

However, EU sanctions were not the only challenge faced by the Kurti administration. Throughout its four-year mandate, allegations of corruption, interference in large tenders, failure to fulfill electoral promises, and deteriorating relations with Kosovo’s key ally, the United States, plagued the government. Former U.S. envoy for the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, Richard Grenell, stated on the social media platform “X” that Kurti had consistently opposed every American initiative from Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, and Trump. In the midst of his re-election campaign, Grenell’s remarks posed a significant challenge to Kurti. In response, Kurti insisted that Kosovo-U.S. relations were stronger than ever. However, Grenell swiftly countered, calling Kurti “delusional” and reminding him that his actions had been condemned by the Trump administration, NATO, the EU, the U.S. Embassy, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

More on this story: Assessing the early elections as a long-term solution to the crisis in north Kosova

The exchange of statements between Kurti and Grenell raises concerns about America’s potential lack of support for Kurti’s leadership in a new mandate. This skepticism is fueled by Kurti’s lack of coordination with the international community, particularly in crisis situations in northern Kosovo. Nonetheless, Kurti’s party, “Levizja Vetevendosje,” in coalition with “Alternativa” and “Guxo,” remains the largest political force in the election, campaigning under the slogan “corner by corner,” signaling an ambition for an even stronger result than in 2021, when they secured over 50% of the vote.

Kosovo’s citizens, however, have multiple alternatives to choose from. The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) is fielding Bedri Hamza as its candidate for Prime Minister. Hamza, a former Minister of Finance in the Thaci government, ex-Governor of the Central Bank, deputy, and mayor of Mitrovica, is a well-respected expert on economic matters. He has also participated in economic negotiations with Serbia. Hamza is regarded as a politician free from scandals, and his campaign focuses on increasing public sector salaries by 50%, economic development, and strengthening relations with international allies.

The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) is presenting Lumir Abdixhiku as its candidate, promising investments of €5 billion, a budget expansion to €5 billion, and an economic growth rate of 5% during his tenure. Meanwhile, the coalition “For a Winning Kosovo,” consisting of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) and Nisma, is running with Ramush Haradinaj as its candidate for Prime Minister. Their campaign centers on Kosovo’s NATO membership, salary increases, and economic investments.

Numerous polls have been conducted to predict the February 9 election results, but many are influenced by individual political preferences. The race remains highly competitive. Based on campaign trends and current developments, “Levizja Vetevendosje” is projected to lose approximately 10% of its previous support, raising concerns that it may struggle to form a government alone. The possibility of forming a coalition government with an opposition party also appears uncertain. Meanwhile, the two largest opposition parties, PDK and LDK, are expected to gain ground compared to the last elections.

Kosovo’s Assembly consists of 120 deputies elected by vote. Of these, 20 seats are reserved for minority communities: 10 for the Serbian community and 10 for other communities, including Turkish, Bosnian, Roma, Ashkali, Goran, and Egyptian representatives.

Serbia rocked by anti-corruption protests after construction tragedy - 1330 WFIN,https://wfin.com/fox-world-news/serbia-rocked-by-anti-corruption-protests-after-construction-tragedy/,1330 WFIN,2025-02-01,"Mass protests have rocked Serbia for months as protesters demand justice and accountability after the deaths of 15 people in the collapse of a railway station.

Tens of thousands of college students have been marching for nearly three months demanding those responsible for the calamity be held accountable and prosecuted accordingly. The canopy at the railway station collapsed Nov. 1 after renovations led by two Chinese companies.

A general strike was called last week, with many calling off work as people blocked major streets in Belgrade and occupied university campuses in solidarity with the young protesters.

“I’ve worked in the Balkans for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Tanya Domi, professor at Columbia University’s Harriman Institute, told Fox News Digital.

KOSOVO ACCUSES SERBIA OF ‘TERRORIST ATTACK’ RESEMBLING RUSSIAN ACTIONS IN UKRAINE

With protests showing no signs of dissipating, Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation, and the mayor of Novi Sad, the city where the tragedy occurred, also stepped down.

“The protests already took down two scalps, and I think more are to come,” Domi said.

The prime minister’s resignation made him the highest regime official to step down, but it hasn’t quelled the uprising. Mass protests continued to break out in Belgrade and across the country.

“The resignation of the prime minister is simply not enough,” Helena Ivanov, senior fellow at the Henry Jackson Institute, told Fox News Digital.

Ivanov said the student-led protesters have clearly defined objectives, including full transparency about the process that led to the collapse and holding those responsible accountable for the loss of life.

The government has thus far been unclear and tried to evade scrutiny by downplaying the government’s culpability. At first, the government tried to ignore the protests, then began to use force and accused the protests of being infiltrated by foreign agitators. Some observers complain the Vucic government’s failure to act and provide clear answers to the public is endemic of Serbia’s core institutional corruption.

ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WANTS TO CAUSE ‘EXPLOSION’ IN THE BALKANS

“For protesters, the Novi Sad railway station canopy collapse cannot be treated as an incident and isolated event, but rather a symptom of more widespread negligence and systemic corruption that precipitated into this tragedy,” Sinisa Vukovic, director of the global policy program at Johns Hopkins University, told Fox News Digital.

The unprecedented resignation of the prime minister leaves the government in flux. The country will either see a new prime minister and government formed within 30 days or face snap elections. However, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic addressed the nation and said he will decide in the next 10 days whether Serbia faces a snap election.

“This is a legitimate challenge to Vucic’s rule and the biggest challenge the president and his party have faced in the 13 years of their rule,” Ivanov added.

Serbia’s Foreign Minister, Marko Djuric, told Fox News Digital Serbia’s commitment to stability, reform and continued growth remains unchanged. The foreign minister said, “We are listening, we are learning and we are determined to ensure that Serbia moves forward on its path of economic and democratic development.”

The protests are the most difficult to deal with from the perspective of the government and the president, Ivanov noted. The students have distanced themselves from the opposition party, which does not have broad support from the public and is generally considered weak and ineffective.

SERBIA, CAUGHT BETWEEN EUROPE AND RUSSIA, COULD MOVE ONE STEP CLOSER TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH KOSOVO

Students across the country are saying this is their fight, not the unpopular political opposition, leading to a greater show of force among the population.

“After 13 years of one individual dominating Serbian politics and 13 years of very important governmental institutions failing to do their job, the key message of these protests is that we expect these institutions to do their job well,” Ivanov said.

Security forces began suppressing the protests, which further exacerbated tensions and motivated more people to join the protests.

Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital the Trump administration should not fall for Serbian President Vucic’s usual tricks of trying to balance between the U.S. and its adversaries.

“Vucic has allowed China’s weapons and investments to thrive in Serbia. Serbia’s close ties to Iran and Russia are also undermining America’s interests. His domestic propaganda portrays the U.S. as an enemy. With friends like Vucic, Washington does not need enemies,” Stradner warned."

""We urgently request that OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) consider immediate assistance, in the form of a suspension of sanctions for a minimum of 90 days, while a sustainable solution that would lead to the lifting of sanctions is considered,"" the statement said.

It also said that NIS's request concerns obtaining licenses that would allow it to continue operating while a solution to the ownership structure and management is sought.

""The (Serbian) government ... supports the request ... because sanctions would impair the company's ability to supply Serbian citizens with oil and oil derivatives,"" the ministry said.

Gazprom Neft and Gazprom have 50% and 6.15% stakes respectively in the company which operates the sole oil refinery in Serbia.

The Serbian government holds a further 29.87% with small shareholders accounting for the remainder.

On Jan. 10, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic said Russian companies were given 45 days to 45 days to exit their ownership in NIS and that any deal would have to be approved by OFAC.

On Jan. 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow was in contact with Belgrade about NIS.

Serbia receives most of its crude oil through Croatia's pipeline operator Janaf, through which Hungary also imports some of its oil.

NIS, one of the biggest contributors to Serbia's state budget, had signed a contract with Janaf for the transport of 10 million tons of oil through Croatia from Jan. 1, 2024 until Dec. 31, 2026.

The Swiss Confederation approved this sale in 2023, the Keystone-SDA news agency has learned.

The Swiss economics ministry told Keystone-SDA that the Confederation approved the delivery of IMSI-catchers, valued at nearly CHF2 million ($2.19 million), to Serbian government departments.

The ministry didn’t specify whether the equipment was delivered to the Serbian secret services or the interior ministry. It also didn’t disclose the name of the Swiss company that supplied the equipment.

In December, Amnesty International revealed that the phones of several activists and journalists had been infiltrated by spyware controlled by Serbian intelligence services. The organisation claims this is a widespread and systematic practice. The country is currently in crisis, with Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigning amid widespread protests against government corruption.

Reading Time: 3 minutes

Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned on Tuesday, 28 January, becoming the latest politician from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) to fall victim to the wave of anti-government protests sweeping the country.

Gov’t on brink after over a decade in power

A canopy collapse after a botched reconstruction of the railway station in Novi Sad, north Serbia, on 1 November 2024, which killed 15 people, has sparked widespread anger and nationwide protests aimed at Serbia’s right-wing government.

Students have blockaded over 60 university faculties in Serbia’s capital city of Belgrade for over 2 months. The protest’s leaders have vowed to maintain these actions until the government gives full transparency regarding the reconstruction project, which ran from 2021-24, and began during Vucevic’s term as mayor of Novi Sad. Although the Novi Sad tragedy was the spark, protesters also have much broader frustrations over alleged state corruption and media restrictions.

City mayor falls on sword

Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also resigned and expressed personal responsibility for attacks in that occurred in the city in the early hours of Tuesday, 28 January, after a gang armed with baseball bats chased student protesters affixing stickers and stencilling slogans.

ADS after 6th paragraph

The resignations of Vucevic and Djuric were among the demands of students and opposition groups. Vucevic said he and Djuric consider themselves “objectively responsible” for the attacks.

Vucevic confirmed that he had consulted with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic before making his decision to quit: “We are displaying the accountability of elected officials”. The outgoing prime minister said he will continue as premier in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed. “A prime minister’s resignation equated to the resignation of the entire cabinet,” he said.

Serbian government has month to avoid snap election

Vucic cannot form a new government, he faces the prospect of a snap election. Under the Constitution, the Serbian Parliament must formally acknowledge Vucevic’s resignation, ending the government’s mandate and kickstarting the selection of a new prime minister. If MPs fail to elect a new government within 30 days, the president is obliged to dissolve Parliament and call elections.

On 29 January, Vucic wrote on Facebook that “in the next ten days, we will make a decision whether to go to elections or to form a new government. No one is above the law and I am proud of that fact. Political responsibility must exist and we must fight for dialogue,” he added.

“I am forever grateful to Milos Vucevic for leading the government honestly, responsibly and seriously, and with results that will go down in history. Milos did his job well, he brought Serbia an investment credit rating: he was always loyal to his homeland, Serbia,” Vucic said.

Students, opposition unmoved by resignations

Opposition parties dismissed Vucevic’s resignation as a strategy to protect the SNS rather than a genuine act of accountability. The Free Citizens Movement said Vucevic’s government “will be remembered for the deaths of 15 people in Novi Sad, the beatings and persecution of students, and the complete dismantling of institutions”.

Democratic Party representative Srdjan Milivojevic directly addressed Vucic on social media, saying, “No resignations, neither Vucevic’s nor yours, will save you after last night’s attack on our children.”

ADS after 15th paragraph

Other opposition figures have called for criminal accountability, arguing that resignations alone are insufficient. The Green-Left Front said: “Never again should Serbia be ruled by a corrupt network that endangers lives and fuels economic and social instability.”

Architect slams clientelism in building industry

The Higher Public Prosecutor’s Office in Novi Sad has filed charges against 13 individuals in connection with the tragedy. Among the accused are former construction, transport and infrastructure minister Goran Vesic, his assistant Anita Dimoski, and erstwhile Serbian Railways director Jelena Tanaskovic. A total of ten suspects are in custody, while Vesic is free, and Tanaskovic and Dimoski are under house arrest.

After the canopy collapse, architect Slobodan Maldini highlighted the negligence, nepotism, and lack of accountability and oversight, in Serbian construction, emphasising the rarity of such tragedies in the 21st Century, in an op-ed in Radar Nova. The piece noted that requests for renovation documentation were denied, allegedly due to objections from Chinese partners involved in the project.

The station was originally built in 1964. A key feature was its cantilevered roof, intended to support a suspended canopy at the front entrance. Over time, concerns arose with the increasingly dilapidated building, as architects warned that the structure had a maximum functio"

Kosovo's Che Guevara' is not for turning - Yahoo News UK,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kosovos-che-guevara-not-turning-064222789.html,Yahoo News UK,2025-02-06,"For four years, Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti has run his government on his own terms -- even as he risked rubbing Kosovo's most important allies up the wrong way and igniting conflict with bitter rival Serbia.

The premier has channelled his maverick energy into upending the status quo that has existed since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, fraying relations with Brussels and Washington while EU-backed negotiations with Serbia collapsed.

Kosovo voters will either endorse Kurti's vision for bold change in elections Sunday or punish him for policies that some see as unnecessarily disruptive.

""Now we know we need confirmation from the people of Kosovo in these elections and we need a sort of democratic license to keep up the good work,"" the 49-year-old leader told AFP as he criss-crossed Kosovo on the campaign trail.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since his days as a dreadlocked student protest leader known as the ""Che Guevara of Kosovo"", Kurti has pushed back against whatever authority he deemed illegitimate -- whether that be the Serbian government, the United Nations or domestic political rivals.

After winning a landslide victory in the 2021 election, Kurti brought his unrelenting mix of left-wing politics and fervent nationalism to Kosovo's highest office.

- Dismantling Serb parallel state -

When ethnic Serb police, judges and bureaucrats walked off the job in the restive north in 2023 to protest the Pristina government's policies, Kurti moved fast to fill the vacuum.

His government appointed mayors to take over vacant offices, sent in ethnic Albania law enforcement to patrol Serb majority areas in the north and began a concerted push to dismantle parallel Serbian government institutions still operating on Kosovo soil.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Serbian dinar was outlawed, the banks where Serbs used the currency were closed along with the post offices where their pension payments were cashed.

Serbian car licence plates were banned for good, while Belgrade-backed government and tax offices were raided and shuttered.

Tensions frequently boiled over in the north, with rioting, armed clashes, and road blockages erupting in ethnic Serb communities near the Serbian border.

The moves have also brought perennially sour ties with Serbia to arguably their lowest point since a bloody war in 1998 between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents in the former Serbian province led to 13,000 deaths, prompting a NATO intervention that ended Belgrade's rule over the territory.

Despite regular protests from the US and Brussels over the moves, Kurti has remained unrepentant.

ADVERTISEMENT

""We brought way more sovereignty to the state and integrity to the territory than all others before us combined and we've done that in a lawful manner,"" said Kurti.

""I'm not saying that (the Kosovo Serbs) are overly enthusiastic about my government but nonetheless they breathe freely now and they cooperate way more with the Albanian majority,"" he added.

But not all agree.

Just days ahead of elections, Kurti was hit with a blistering salvo from one of President Donald Trump's long-time advisors.

""Both Republicans and Democrats have criticised Kurti consistently for taking unilateral actions that destabilise the region. So has the EU and NATO. The international community is united against Kurti,"" wrote US envoy Richard Grenell on social media.

Others have warned that Kurti and his Vetevendosje party's primary focus on its fight against Serbian institutions risks ignoring voters worried about bread and butter issues.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The two leading opposition parties, which are running on platforms emphasising economic issues, seem to be having enough of a resurgence to complicate Kurti's ability to form a government,"" wrote political analyst Agon Maliqi.

- Carrots and selfies -

A former student activist renowned for his radical antics, Kurti first gained fame on the streets, organising demonstrations in the 1990s against the Serbian regime's repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.

He spent more than two years in a Serbian jail before being released in late 2001.

After the province broke away from Serbia in the 1998-99 war, Kurti became a fiery opponent of both local leaders and the international community.

When he entered politics, Kurti's and his opposition allies lawmakers gained notoriety for unleashing tear gas inside the legislator.

But as premier, he has cut a more professional image wearing sharp suits, all while citing the latest economic data or courting Kosovo's diaspora.

During a campaign stop at a farm outside Pristina this week, Kurti posed for selfies next to a tractor and snacked on a carrot, as he laughed with factory workers.

And he brushed off the latest criticism from Washington.

""As a prime minister I have to worry all of the time,"" he told AFP. ""But I have to move ahead, move forward all of the time.""

Serbia protesters mark three months since deadly roof collapse - Yahoo News UK,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/serbia-protesters-mark-three-months-190726654.html,Yahoo News UK,2025-02-01,"Thousands of protesters blocked roads and occupied bridges in Serbia's Novi Sad on Saturday to pressure the government three months after the fatal collapse of a train station roof in the city sparked an anti-corruption movement.

The demonstration was the latest in a series of mass protests to rock the Balkan country in the wake of the roof cave-in that killed 15 people in the northern Serbian city in November.

The university student-led movement has put increasing pressure on the government, spurring the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including that of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic earlier this week.

The premier's resignation came after a 24-hour blockade at a major traffic intersection in the capital Belgrade.

It was preceded days before by a general strike that saw schools and small businesses close across the country.

The collapse of the station roof in Novi Sad followed extensive renovations to the building.

The accident fuelled long-standing anger in Serbia over corruption and the alleged lack of oversight in construction projects.

""There is no turning back, no fear, and we will not give up,"" Jelena Vuksanovic, a philosophy student in Novi Sad, told AFP as protesters converged on downtown for the hours-long rally.

Ahead of the demonstration, traffic entering Novi Sad remained heavily congested, with a long line waiting to pass through tolls to reach the city.

As the protest kicked off, thousands marched through Novi Sad's streets waving flags and signs as they chanted anti-corruption slogans, while blocking roads and occupying the city's three main bridges.

The demonstrators later converged on the largest of the three crossings, Freedom Bridge, where the protesters planned to spend the night and block until Sunday.

Farmers on tractors joined the protest along with residents of Novi Sad, with some setting up food stands to provide meals for demonstrators, while boats flying the Serbia flag sailed along the Danube River cutting through the city.

""I don't think anything like this has ever happened in Novi Sad before. And I am certain that Gen Z will bring change because I believe in all these young people,"" said law student Nedeljka Mijanovic.

- Student-led -

University students have emerged as the leaders of the protest movement and have been blockading campuses across the country for weeks.

President Aleksandar Vucic and other government officials have swung between issuing calls for talks and firing off allegations that the demonstrators are being backed by foreign powers.

To quell the protests, the government has sought to meet several of the student organisers' demands.

Those measures have included releasing a raft of documents related to the renovations at the station; pardoning protesters arrested at rallies; boosting funding for higher education; and launching criminal proceedings against suspects accused of attacking demonstrators.

But meeting many of the protesters' demands might not be enough to satisfy the students, said Bojan Klacar, the director of CeSID, an organisation monitoring elections in Serbia.

""It has become a broader movement where deeper, systemic changes are being demanded,"" Klacar told AFP.

Ahead of Saturday's rally, hundreds of students left Belgrade on Thursday for a two-day march to Novi Sad.

They have been greeted by residents in villages and towns along the 80-kilometre (50-mile) route.

ADVERTISEMENT

""I am walking to pay tribute to all the victims of the great tragedy that took place in Novi Sad,"" one marcher told AFP as the students departed Belgrade.

The first groups of protesters entered Novi Sad late on Friday, where they were greeted by crowds of cheering local residents.

""You only see this once in your life,"" Dalibor Mitrovic, 45, told AFP, as he watched the students arrive.

Tensions have flared occasionally in recent weeks, with violence breaking out at some protests. Students have accused pro-government hooligans of targeting demonstrations.

"Stevan Gajić: Serbian protests are about restoring institutions, not regime change - INTERVIEW - News.Az",https://news.az/news/stevan-gaji-serbian-protests-are-about-restoring-institutions-not-regime-change-interview,News.Az,2025-02-05,"News.az presents an interview with Stevan Gajić, a renowned Serbian political expert, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies (Belgrade), and a visiting professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO).

- What are the main reasons behind the student and faculty protests in Serbia?

- A tragedy occurred in Serbia: on November 1, 2024, the recently renovated bus station in the city of Novi Sad collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 15 people. The reconstruction of the station cost €65 million—an astronomical sum for a project of this nature. This immediately raised suspicions of large-scale corruption, which many believe is a systemic feature of the ruling party under Aleksandar Vučić. Increasingly, the authorities are being compared not to a political organization but to an organized criminal group.

Students participating in the protests have put forward several key demands. First and foremost, they call for the full disclosure of all documentation related to the station’s reconstruction, including tender conditions, information about contractors, and a detailed breakdown of payments—who received the funds, when, and under what conditions. The public has the right to know where this money has gone.

Additionally, students demand the immediate dismissal of charges against those arrested during the initial days of the protests. These individuals bear no responsibility for the tragedy, and their detention serves only as a means of exerting pressure on demonstrators.

Another crucial demand is the identification of all individuals who attacked students during the protests. There have been multiple documented incidents of attacks by unidentified assailants, including the use of baseball bats. In one such attack in Novi Sad, a female student suffered a triple jaw fracture. It is imperative that all those responsible be held accountable. If any of the perpetrators hold government positions, they must be dismissed immediately.

Protesters are also calling for a 20% increase in university funding. For years, the government has cut education spending, leading to its deterioration. Furthermore, there were previous attempts to license foreign universities with full state funding, allowing them to operate solely under their own curricula while disregarding national education standards. Fortunately, public opposition prevented this plan from being implemented.

Today, the protests extend beyond the issue of corruption; they represent a broader struggle for transparency in state institutions and the protection of the education system.

- What consequences has the Serbian government already faced as a result of the mass protests?

- The consequences are clear: the government has fallen, and Miloš Vučević has resigned. As a result, our government is now in a caretaker capacity.

- What are the potential long-term implications of these protests for Serbia’s education system and political landscape?

- If the truth comes to light and the students’ demands are fully met, the government will face a significant challenge. This entire scandal inevitably leads to the president’s office, as those behind the companies responsible for the station’s reconstruction have close ties to the head of state. Moreover, there are rumors that some of these companies’ owners may be his close relatives.

There is a possibility that Vučić himself, along with his ministers, was directly involved in this project, given the scale of corruption and the enormous opportunities for embezzling state funds.

- How has the Serbian government responded to the protesters’ demands, and what concessions have been made?

Image:jacobin

- The authorities’ response to the protests has been highly inadequate. From the outset, they attempted to suppress the demonstrations by force. In Novi Sad, during the first protest, the government deployed masked individuals who began rioting and vandalizing city infrastructure to discredit the demonstrators. However, video footage soon emerged clearly showing these individuals entering and exiting the offices of the Serbian Progressive Party. This exposed their involvement in the provocations.

Rather than acknowledging their responsibility, the authorities continued an aggressive campaign against the students, accusing them of violence. Physical intimidation of protesters has become a regular occurrence. Particularly alarming have been instances of deliberate vehicle attacks on demonstrators, including women participating in blockades. Fortunately, no fatalities have occurred, but these intimidation tactics reveal the panic and fear gripping the government.

Vucevic: Decision on the new government or elections in the next two weeks - vreme.com,https://vreme.com/en/razno/vucevic-odluka-o-novoj-vladi-ili-izborima-u-naredne-dve-nedelje/,vreme.com,2025-02-05,"While arguing about whether he really resigned or not, Miloš Vučević says that he is still the Prime Minister, but that it is a matter of days when his resignation will be confirmed in the National Assembly

Decision on the new Vladi or calling for elections should be passed in the next two weeks, he said on K1 television Milos Vucevic, Prime Minister in resignations.

""I made the decision that at this moment a new government with a new mandate should be elected or elections should be held."" This is a decision that awaits us in the next ten days, two weeks"", said Vučević, Prime Minister and the first man of the Serbian Progressive Party, answering the question of whether he will be the new representative of the future Government of Serbia.

Legally and politically, it is possible for him to be the new mandate holder, Vucevic said, adding that this is not an option at the moment.

""I'm almost sure, that's not the topic at all."" It would depend on the president of the republic and me, but I would resign in order to get a new mandate. If I wanted to reconstruct the government, then I would reconstruct it as prime minister, I should not return the mandate, so that I can win it,"" said Vucevic.

Did Vucevic resign?

Vucevic, let's recall, in his address to the public at the press conference on January 28 announced that resigns irrevocably.

Miloš Vučević, a guest on K1 television more than a week later, when asked by a journalist how he signs it, says: ""Like Miloš Vučević, I am still the Prime Minister and it is a matter of days when the resignation will be confirmed in the Serbian Parliament.""

According to the Constitution of Serbia and the Law on the Government, the Prime Minister submits his resignation to the President of the National Assembly, and the Assembly, at the next session, confirms the resignation without discussion. The government's mandate ends on the day of the Prime Minister's resignation, as stated in the Constitution and the Government Law, and the 30-day period for making a decision on calling new elections or electing a new Government begins.

The Assembly session at which the Prime Minister's resignation was supposed to be confirmed was still not held, which effectively means that the termination of his mandate and the mandate of the entire Government has not ended. What did ""Vreme"" write about?.

""I see that it was also in some media yesterday - whether I submitted my resignation or not. I am a serious and responsible person enough that when I appeared in front of the public of Serbia that day and said that it was my irrevocable resignation, there is no more playing around with it,"" said Vučević in an interview on K1 television.

There is still no information on when the session will be held, and the first regular session of the parliament is held on the first working day in March. It is not known whether in the meantime an extraordinary session will be scheduled at which Vucevic's resignation should be confirmed.

Vucevic himself has no information on when the session will be held, he tells K1.

If Vucevic really submitted his resignation officially, and not only on television, then the Assembly should state it at the next session.

Then the 30-day period would begin to run to find a new mandate holder or to announce elections, which are held between 45 and 60 days from the date of the announcement.

In the three months since 15 people were killed when a roof collapsed at a newly-renovated train station in the city of Novi Sad, mass anti-corruption demonstrations have spread across the Balkan state to become Serbia's biggest protest movement in years. It also poses the starkest threat to populist President Aleksandar Vucic's decade-long grip on power.

Despite near-freezing temperatures, crowds of students arrived in Kragujevac from across Serbia, by bus and even on foot from the capital Belgrade, some 140 km away, beating drums, blowing whistles and holding up the country's flag.

Protesters held 15 minutes of silence, with plans to blockade one of the city's main boulevards for 15 hours and 15 minutes, in a symbolic tribute to the victims.

Joined by teachers, farmers and other workers, the students have enjoyed support from the wider public, with many Serbians blaming the Novi Sad tragedy on corruption and nepotism within Vucic's government, allegations authorities deny."
Serb party ends boycott to fight Kosovo election - Yahoo News UK,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/serb-party-ends-boycott-fight-065650977.html,Yahoo News UK,2025-02-06,"A Kosovo police officer during the armed standoff with Serbs in 2023 (Armend NIMANI) (Armend NIMANI/AFP/AFP)

Kosovo's leading ethnic Serb party is taking part in parliamentary elections there Sunday after years of boycotts and a leadership reshuffle after one its top figures was involved in an armed standoff with police.

The Serb List has long served as the de-facto proxy of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in Belgrade, drawing the ire of the Albanian majority government in Pristina.

The party has dominated the remaining pockets of Serb communities left in Kosovo, including a stretch of municipalities near the border with Serbia.

But the government in Pristina has accused it of smuggling, money laundering and controlling its turf with an iron hand, complaining that it was behind rioting and the blocking of roads in the restive north.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti was elected to office in 2021, the Serb List has largely boycotted local elections -- igniting a showdown in 2023 when Pristina installed four Albanian mayors in Serb areas, leading to months of unrest.

Tensions came to a head in September 2023 when a Serb commando squad led by the Serb List's deputy chair Milan Radoicic ambushed a Kosovo police patrol, leading to an hours-long armed standoff at an Orthodox monastery.

Radoicic later fled to Serbia where he admitted to masterminding the attack.

Since then the party has steadily reshaped its top brass and has now vowed to end its boycotts, as it prepares to compete for the 10 mandated seats for ethnic Serbs in parliament that comes with a powerful veto over legislation affecting the community.

""From the Serbian government and Serb List, you will certainly continue to receive support,"" said new party president Zlatan Elek during a campaign speech last month.

""We don't want to make promises we cannot fulfill.""

- Ballots and barricades -

Animosity between Kosovo and Serbia has persisted since the war between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents in the late 1990s in the breakaway Serbian province.

Belgrade and the Serb minority in northern Kosovo have long refused to acknowledge Pristina's declaration of independence in 2008.

The party is wary of overly engaging with Pristina for fear of being seen as recognising its authority. with its 10 MPs only appearing briefly every six months in parliament to sign an attendance sheet to prevent their expulsion.

But following years of unrest and and a tough crackdown by Kurti's government on the last remnants of Serbian institutions still operating in Kosovo, the party may be preparing to recalibrate.

ADVERTISEMENT

""I think that Serb List understood what it means not to be inside the system and not taking part in political decision making,"" said Jovana Radosavljevic from the New Social Initiative based in the northern Kosovo city of Mitrovica.

Serb List is competing with five other ethnic Serb parties in Sunday's vote, including some that have begun openly cooperating with the government in Pristina.

Many have said they are being pressured behind the scenes by Serb List.

We ""are being threatened and punished by the Serb List"", said Nenad Rasic, Kosovo's minister for communities, adding that his deputy's wife had been fired from her job due to the party's influence.

- Uncertain future -

Questions remain though on what exactly Serb List would do if re-elected to the parliament.

ADVERTISEMENT

For the past four years, the party's MPs shunned parliament, with hundreds of ethnic Serb police officers, judges, prosecutors and local administrations in the north also quitting their positions.

The boycotts led to a vacuum in Serb areas, allowing Kurti's government to place ethnic Albanian officials in the local bureaucracy and dismantle most of the remaining parallel Serbian institutions left in Kosovo -- including banks, postal services and local government offices.

The moves have arguably left Serb List at its weakest point in years with its former base despondent.

""I have never voted and I will not vote,"" Sladjan Trajkovic, a 23-year-old student, told AFP in Mitrovica.

""We have hoped for 25 years for better, and it is getting worse,"" added 68-year-old taxi driver Radoje Milic.

""In fact, we do not know who is worse for us -- Pristina or Belgrade.""

The protests are led by students. They are not demanding a change of government, but responsibility for the deaths of 15 people in the collapse of a shelter at the Novi Sad Railway Station on November 1st of last year.

At the heart of the protests are suspicions that the accident may have been caused by negligence and widespread corruption. They have now become a symbol of broader dissatisfaction with the rule of law in Serbia.

""This is not only the most serious political crisis of the government, but also a deep social crisis. The students are not asking for a change of government, but for the correction of the system. And Vučić is not able to find the key to the lock they have set,"" Serbian foreign policy analyst Boško Jakšić told Radio Free Europe.

When Vučić invites them to talks, the students say he is not competent. University professors, pedagogues, lawyers and farmers have also joined their demands.

Some teachers have suspended classes in schools, the Serbian Bar Association has gone on a month-long strike, farmers are ""guarding"" with tractors the blockades that students have made of over 60 faculties...

The students have been joined by tens of thousands of other citizens in the protests, including high school students, healthcare workers, engineers, actors, musicians, and numerous public figures.

Changes in public broadcaster reporting

Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), which has largely ignored the protests, opened its news program last weekend with the protests in Novi Sad. The reporting by the public broadcaster, which is under tight government control, was accompanied by drone footage showing tens of thousands of people protesting and blocking three bridges over the Danube River.

Vučić's Serbian Progressive Party reacted with a statement, accusing RTS of ""serious abuse of the journalistic profession"" and of ""biasing politicians who want to destroy the constitutional order of Serbia.""

The ruling party has also said that it will seek a response from the institutions responsible for financial and programming oversight of RTS.

This is not the first time that the Serbian president has criticized RTS, but the public broadcaster has, so far, followed the narrative of the authorities, whom protesters call ""foreign mercenaries"", ""traitors"" or ""opposition puppets"".

""Clearly, RTS has reacted to pressure from students and the general public, and perhaps this is a consequence of a different atmosphere in the entire society. The response of the authorities was such that RTS did not go any further. Something similar has happened in several previous protests ,"" Nikola Burazer from the non-governmental Center for Contemporary Politics in Serbia tells Radio Free Europe.

Requests for change of leadership

After several mass protests in front of the RTS building, due to the way it reports, they have been joined by several employees of the public broadcaster, demanding a change in leadership. Protests with similar demands are also being organized by several employees of Radio Television of Vojvodina (RTV).

""In the first television program, we were not able to hear the students, their demands, the citizens, the analytical stories..."", Tamara Srijemac, a journalist at Radio Novi Sad, which operates within RTV, told Radio Free Europe. On February 3, while the main news edition was being broadcast, several RTV employees organized a performance outside the building, reading the ""free diary"".

""We wanted to show that some employees distance themselves from such editorial policies,"" Srijemac said.

The heads of RTS and RTV did not respond to Radio Free Europe's questions on this topic. A similar scenario followed the protests of the 1990s, when Serbia's public broadcaster was at the service of the propaganda of the Slobodan Milosevic regime.

On the eve of his downfall, which followed the war in Kosovo and NATO intervention, Serbia's current president, Vučić, was the minister of information. Vučić implemented a notorious law that was used by the then government to crack down on independent media and journalists. He has maintained control over the media even after returning to power in 2012.

The European Commission and other international organizations mention this in all annual reports on Serbia.

Failure to discredit the protests

In addition to public broadcasters, the Serbian government also controls private television stations with national coverage. Pro-government tabloids are also a powerful media weapon in efforts to discredit current and past protests.

""... but, the government, so far, has failed to achieve the effects it could have achieved earlier. Vučić, much more easily, could have discredited the opposition leaders or some other protest le"

"Ukraine, USAID, or Something Else? — Unmasking Slovakia’s Anti-Government Protests - Hungarian Conservative",https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/politics/slovakia-anti-government-protest-ngo-network-coup-robert-fico-serbia-georgia/,Hungarian Conservative,2025-02-05,"Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is facing increasing scrutiny as his government struggles to stay in power following the departure of MPs from the junior coalition party Hlas-SD earlier in January. Fico is also engaged in a war of words with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over Kyiv’s decision to halt Russian gas transit through Ukrainian territory, a dispute that has been ongoing since December last year. In addition to these challenges, mass anti-government protests swept across Slovakia last week and over the weekend, fuelled by allegations that the government is shifting its foreign policy towards Moscow at the expense of its commitments to the European Union and NATO.

Considering that it is only February, a series of major and difficult-to-resolve problems lie ahead for the Slovak prime minister. Fico has responded by accusing the opposition and foreign forces—mainly Ukraine—of organizing a coup attempt against him. He claimed that a classified report from the country’s SIS intelligence service revealed serious evidence of a long-term, organized influence operation aimed at destabilizing Slovakia. Later, Fico added that ‘a group of experts is working on Slovak territory, having actively participated in…the [2013–14] uprising in Ukraine…I especially welcome the decision of [United States] President [Donald] Trump to put an end to the financing of these senseless activities in Europe that seriously endanger democracy,’ referring to the Trump administration’s current crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is widely regarded as an extended arm of the CIA’s foreign influence operations.

Fico also accused an NGO called Peace for Ukraine of being behind the protests, allegedly in cooperation with the Georgian Legion, a volunteer-based unit fighting against Russia in Ukraine. Slovakia recently banned Georgian Legion commander Mamuka Mamulashvili from entering the country due to alleged links to the coup attempt. The Georgian Legion dismissed the allegations as ‘absurd and groundless’. Notably, Zelenskyy endorsed the anti-government protests, stating: ‘Bratislava is not Moscow, Slovakia is Europe.’

Network Behind the Protests

Not long ago, the Western mainstream could easily dismiss Fico’s claims as yet another right-wing conspiracy theory. However, with Trump’s team exposing USAID’s foreign interference and meddling under the guise of aid and assistance, every anti-government protest targeting sovereignist governments appears more suspicious. And as we have seen many times before, so-called right-wing conspiracy theories often turn out to be true sooner or later—such as the lab leak theory surrounding COVID-19. Fico’s allegations may not be far from reality either.

Slovak conservative newspaper Hlavné Správy has published an investigative report on the recent protests in Slovakia, mapping the network of NGOs behind them. Their findings confirm that Peace for Ukraine played a role in organizing some of the demonstrations, but it was not the primary leader of the network.

Running through the leadership of Peace for Ukraine, several interesting—though unsurprising—connections emerge. One of the key figures in the organization is Andrea Cocherová, former vice-chair of the Slovak Democratic Party. Her involvement signals deep coordination between the leading NGOs behind the protests and the Slovak opposition. Moreover, she has spent a significant portion of her career at Pontis Foundation, a major player in Slovakia’s pseudo-civil society, as Magyar Nemzet previously reported. Pontis is also known for its extensive links to George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF).

Another prominent figure is Marian Kulich, a well-known civic activist with ties to the opposition party Progressive Slovakia (PO) and Team Bratislava, a municipal-level coalition of opposition politicians and candidates.

Lucia Štasselová is also linked to Team Bratislava, Progressive Slovakia, and Freedom and Solidarity (SAS). She may be a key link between the protests and the Georgian Legion, as she has been photographed alongside its commander, Mamuka Mamulashvili.

However, as Hlavné Správy highlighted in their report, all NGOs involved in organizing the demonstrations are linked to a single umbrella organization: Platform for Democracy (PPD). The paper notes that PPD and its member organizations have actively participated in various civic initiatives and protests since 2017—whenever Robert Fico has been in power.

‘All NGOs involved in organizing the demonstrations are linked to a single umbrella organization: Platform for Democracy’

PPD, unsurprisingly, is linked to Soros’s OSF. The platform enjoys strong media coverage, as it unites organizations with close ties to mainstream media, including major television networks and newspapers. These outlets often present their protests as legitimate citizen initiatives while downplaying or negatively portraying spontaneous protests that do not align w"

The mystery of Vucevic's resignation: Maybe the mail isn't working - Time - vreme.com,https://vreme.com/en/vesti/misterija-vuceviceve-ostavke-mozda-posta-ne-radi/,vreme.com,2025-02-05,"Apparently, Prime Minister Miloš Vucevic resigned only in front of the cameras. Transparency Serbia is now asking the Government and the Assembly to show their official resignation, if there is one at all

The day after ""Vreme"" wrote that Miloš Vučević is the prime minister, apparently, resigned only on television, and Transparency Serbia she sent an official request to the Government and the Assembly to submit the text of her resignation.

Namely, Vucevic said at the press conference last week that he was resigning, which would also mean the fall of the Government.

However, the law says that the Prime Minister must officially inform the President of the Assembly about it, and then the Parliament, at the first next session, only notes the resignation.

It was only then that the Government fell and the deadlines for electing a new representative or calling for elections began to run.

""There is no official information on the parliamentary website that the resignation has been submitted,"" Nemanja Nenadić, program director of Transparency Serbia, told Vreme.

Does resignation even exist?

That is why Transparency sent official requests to the Government and the Assembly. ""Vreme"" has not yet received answers from the Prime Minister's office, the Government and the Assembly to the same question.

""Maybe the prime minister sent his resignation by post, and the post office is out of date, so it can't deliver a few hundred meters away,"" says Nenadić jokingly, and then continues:

""It is much more likely that the resignation has not yet been officially submitted because it is the same government that is promoting the Leap into the Future program until 2027 on its website, even though that program does not exist at all, as the government itself has admitted.""

Elections can be pushed until June

The matter is not only of a formal nature. Namely, Miloš Vučević's government is still in its full mandate - this means that it can still send bills to the Parliament and staff public companies.

For now, there are no indications that there will be extraordinary sessions of the Assembly, and the Parliament could only meet regularly, on March 3.

If Vučević really submitted his resignation officially, and not only on television, then the Assembly would then have to state it.

Then the 30-day period would begin to run to find a new mandate holder or to announce elections, which are held between 45 and 60 days from the date of the announcement.

It turns out that the authorities of Aleksandar Vučić, by complicating everything with the resignation of the Government, could gain additional room for maneuver. New elections could be held only on June 1."
Serbia student protests demand justice and political change - Weekly Blitz,https://weeklyblitz.net/2025/02/15/serbia-student-protests-demand-justice-and-political-change/,Weekly Blitz,2025-02-15,"Serbia student protests demand justice and political change

In November 2024, a tragedy struck the Serbian city of Novi Sad, leading to one of the most significant political movements in the country in recent years. The roof of a newly renovated railway station collapsed, killing 15 people. While the government initially downplayed the incident, suggesting that it was a result of unforeseen structural issues, the tragedy has sparked a national movement. The protesters, primarily students, believe the collapse was the result of government corruption and nepotism that led to the use of substandard construction materials and poor oversight. Although the government denies the allegations, the incident became the catalyst for a massive outcry and widespread protests across Serbia.

At the heart of this movement is Marija Petrovic, a molecular biology student at the University of Belgrade. Petrovic, like many others, was driven to join the protests after the accident. The emotional toll of the tragedy resonated deeply within her, as she and her peers believed that the government’s negligence had cost innocent lives. Initially, the protests seemed like a small, isolated event, with only a few students and concerned citizens demanding justice. However, within three months, the protests had grown exponentially, gaining the support of teachers, lawyers, and workers across the country. What began as a student-led demonstration against corruption quickly escalated into one of the largest protest movements Serbia had seen in years, transcending its initial focus and evolving into a call for political reform and accountability.

The students have made their message clear: they want an end to the corrupt practices that have taken root within the government and the ruling political elite. Their demands include the publication of documents related to the station roof collapse, justice for those responsible, the dismissal of charges against protesting students, and increased funding for higher education. Although Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and several key ministers have resigned in the wake of the disaster, the students have continued their protests, insisting that it is not enough. For them, the government’s resignation is merely a first step toward addressing the deep-rooted issues that they claim have plagued Serbia for years.

The protests are not only about the tragedy in Novi Sad but also about broader societal concerns. The demonstrators accuse the government of being autocratic, with its ties to organized crime and a history of undermining democracy. Serbia’s prime minister and president, Aleksandar Vucic, have long been seen as figures who dominate the political landscape, stifling opposition and controlling the media. Critics accuse Vucic’s Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) of engaging in corrupt practices, including voter bribery and the suppression of free speech. These accusations have gained traction in recent years as Serbia’s position on global corruption indices has steadily worsened. The country now ranks 105th out of 180 nations in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.

Vucic’s government has faced international scrutiny for its ties with Russia, as well as its handling of domestic affairs. However, despite these challenges, Vucic has maintained a firm grip on power, using his position to leverage political influence and maintain popular support. But now, for the first time in years, the protests have created a significant challenge to his rule. According to political analysts, the student protests have pushed Vucic into one of the most vulnerable positions of his political career. As Mario Bikarski, senior Europe analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, notes, “The perception of corruption remains the key issue for protesters, who are likely to remain active until they receive meaningful guarantees on the issue.”

One of the key factors contributing to the success of these protests is the level of organization and strategic planning involved. The student-led movement has proven to be highly effective due to its decentralized structure. The old student parliament at the University of Belgrade has been replaced with “plenums” – daily assemblies where students from each faculty vote on their course of action. This lack of a single leader or spokesperson has made it difficult for the government to target individuals or break the movement. Every day, a different student spokesperson speaks for the group, further diffusing any central leadership. Working groups within the movement focus on different aspects of the protests, including strategy, security, and fundraising. These groups coordinate not only in Belgrade but across other university towns, ensuring that their demands and actions remain aligned.

The movement’s message is clear, consistent, and tightly controlled. Students have adopted a red handprint as a symbol of the blood they believe is on the government’s hands. The protests are ongoing"
Vučić blames student protests on the West while simultaneously receiving Western support - European Western Balkans,https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2025/02/07/vucic-blames-student-protests-on-the-west-while-simultaneously-receiving-western-support/,European Western Balkans,2025-02-07,"In 1984, George Orwell came up with the concept of “double-think” which is the acceptance of two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. Those who have been following the current protests in Serbia through statements from officials and media close to the government are currently practising this skill, as they are expected to accept two truths at once – that the West is trying to overthrow President Vučić, and that the West supports President Vučić.

The first “truth”, that the West is trying to overthrow the President and the Government in Serbia, has been circulated for several months since the protests began after the collapse of the canopy in Novi Sad. This is nothing new – the whole narrative has been heard many times, especially during the anti-government protests that seem to be occurring more frequently and with increasing intensity in Serbia.

Thus, during a recent tour through the Rasina District in central Serbia, organized as a reaction to the ongoing protests, the President stated that the country was being attacked “from the outside and from the inside.”

“Just when we pulled the country out of widespread poverty when Serbia started moving forward, it was suddenly attacked from the outside with huge amounts of money invested in unrest within the country, and further fueled by those irresponsible politicians in Serbia who want to return to power at any cost, without elections,” said Aleksandar Vučić in the municipality of Brus.

A few weeks earlier, during an appearance on pro-government Happy TV, the President spoke in more detail about the alleged attempt at a colour revolution being carried out against Serbia.

“Everything they are doing is an attempt at a colour revolution. And there is no doubt about that… All of this is being done by foreign instructors, coming from several Western countries. Some are coming from the East, where they carried out dirty work for the Western intelligence network,” Vučić explained to the show’s host, Milomir Marić.

He added that “there is a combination of several Western intelligence agencies and regional agencies, primarily from Croatia but also Albanian ones, i.e. from Kosovo, as well as some others, aiming to destroy Serbia from within so that it cannot be a serious factor on the international stage and so that it would collapse through inter-Serb conflicts.”

Miloš Vučević, Prime Minister of Serbia, also spoke about the toppling of the country from abroad when he announced that he would resign on 28 January 2025. Vučević said that the atmosphere in society, where “everything is on the brink of conflict,” is “absolutely orchestrated from abroad.”

Vučević did not specify where such an atmosphere was created, but readers of government-friendly media likely had no difficulty filling in that gap themselves.

“The CIA is attacking Serbia through intermediaries! It won’t last much longer?!”, “Now it’s all clear, the West is behind the ‘student protests’,” “They created chaos according to the Maidan recipe,” were some of the headlines that appeared in tabloids close to the government, in this case, Informer and Večernje Novosti, over the past months, pointing the finger at one particular side of the world. Based on reports from these media outlets, one could get the impression that we are witnessing one of the most intense conflicts between the President and the West so far.

A victim or a partner?

Then, especially at the end of January, alongside the first “truth”, that the West is trying to overthrow Vučić, a second “truth” began to emerge – that the West supports Vučić. It all began with a post on X by Richard Grenell, the Special Envoy for United States President Donald Trump, about the protests in Serbia.

Grenell, who is familiar with the Balkans from his time as the Special Envoy for the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue during Trump’s first term, posted on X on January 25 that, while supporting the right to protest, he opposed the “violent takeover of government institutions.” This was widely interpreted as taking the side of the government and its interpretation of the protests.

Almost simultaneously with Grenell’s post, statements about the protests were made by Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mao Ning, the spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although both statements were made in a diplomatic tone, they were interpreted as support for the authorities in Serbia.

On 27 January, Večernje Novosti reported that the “powerful trio,” meaning the USA, Russia, and China, opposed a change of government in Serbia, and Srpski Telegraf stated that both “America and Russia together” condemned the protests in Serbia, which, as noted, “has never happened in history.”

It is always important to raise your voice and to be heard. But everyone must condemn violence and stick to peaceful demonstrations. The democratic process must be respected. We do not support those who undermine the rule of law or who forc"

Miloš Vucevic did not resign? - vreme.com,https://vreme.com/en/vesti/milos-vucevic-nije-podneo-ostavku/,vreme.com,2025-02-04,"A week has passed since the resignation of Miloš Vučević on television, however, the session of the National Assembly at which the resignation should be confirmed has still not been held, which means that the Government is not yet technically

Prime Minister of the Serbian Government Milos Vucevic he submitted his resignation seven days ago (January 28). On television.

However, according to the Constitution of Serbia and the Law on Vladi, the path to the resignation of the Prime Minister and the members of the Government is somewhat different - the Prime Minister submits his resignation to the President of the National Assembly, and the members of the public at the first subsequent trade union meeting state the resignation without discussion. The term of office of the Government ends on the day of the confirmation of the resignation of the Prime Minister, as stated in the Constitution and the Law on Government.

Although a week has passed since Prime Minister Vučević addressed the public with the words that he was submitting his resignation, the session of the Assembly where it should have been confirmed has still not been held, which effectively means that the termination of his mandate and the mandate of the entire Government has not ended.

The session of the Assembly was scheduled for Wednesday, January 28, but was canceled on the same day when the Prime Minister addressed the public. The date of the extraordinary session of the National Assembly, at which the resignation could be confirmed, is not yet known.

""Vreme"" addressed to the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Prime Minister's Cabinet and the National Assembly the question of when the session of the Assembly will be held at which the resignation should be noted and whether Prime Minister Vucevic resigned only on television or if he sent it to the Speaker of the National Assembly Ana Brnabić, as is provided by law and the Constitution, however, no one answered our inquiries.

The first regular session of the Assembly, according to the Law on the National Assembly, begins on the first working day in March, which this year is March 3. In practice, this means that, if an extraordinary parliamentary session is not held in the meantime, the prime minister's mandate will be valid until then, even if he has indeed submitted his resignation to the president of the National Assembly.

When the National Assembly determines the resignation of the Prime Minister, the President of the Republic is obliged to initiate the procedure for the election of a new Government. If the National Assembly does not elect a new Government within 30 days from the date of the Prime Minister's resignation, the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve the National Assembly and call for elections.

Lawyer Rodoljub Šabić, in a post on the social network X (Iks), asked whether the government would delay notifying the resignation until the regular session, so that the 30-day deadline for electing a new government would then be counted, adding that in that case, when that deadline expires, parliamentary elections could be called for mid-June."
"What key contract did the government hide from the public, and why could the Prosecutor's Office bring it back to the beginning? - vreme.com",https://vreme.com/en/vesti/proces-za-pad-nadstresnice/,vreme.com,2025-02-04,"The higher public prosecutor's office in Novi Sad filed charges against 13 people in the case of the fall of the canopy at the train station in Novi Sad. However, due to the disclosure of an international contract with Chinese contractors, which has been kept secret until now, it could be back to square one. And that contract is very unusual

The commercial contract on the construction of the high-speed railway Novi Sad - Subotica, which was signed by the then Deputy Prime Minister Zorana Mihajlović with Chinese contractors in July 2018, and which became available to the public last week, could significantly disrupt the investigation so far Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Novi Sad which indicted 13 persons in the proceedings fall of the canopy at the train station in Novi Sad. The reason is simple: this contract, and this was confirmed when it was disclosed, has the character of an international contract, and therefore has superiority over national legislation.

The Constitution of Serbia, Article 16, determines that ""confirmed international treaties and generally accepted rules of international law are part of the legal order of the Republic of Serbia and are directly applicable"" and that they ""must be in accordance with the Constitution"".

Therefore, the commercial contract between the Government of the Republic of Serbia and Chinese contractors on the construction of a high-speed railway on the section Novi Sad - Subotica, which was signed on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the Government of the People's Republic of China from 2009, as well as other intergovernmental agreements between Serbia and China, concluded in the period from 2009 to 2014, which is clearly stated in its preamble, is an international agreement that, according to the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, has stronger legal force than domestic laws.

That is why it is unclear how the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Novi Sad could ignore this contract when conducting the investigation and bringing the indictment?

Unusual contract

The commercial contract with the Chinese contractors is particularly important because it reveals two key things.

First, this contract in its preamble contains a provision that the entire project of the construction of the high-speed line Novi Sad - Subotica, and thus the reconstruction of the station in Novi Sad, which is an integral part of it, is carried out on the basis of the project assignment prepared in 2017 by the Transport Institute CIP.

By adopting the Agreement, the Government also adopted the Project Terms of Reference, which is an integral part of the Agreement. The case in which the project task is an integral part of the contract, according to the experts interviewed by ""Vreme"", is very unusual.

That project task determined the scope, dynamics and type of works that did not include the reconstruction of the canopy in the lobby B of the station building in Novi Sad, which collapsed on November 1 last year, which led to the death of 15 people.

Despite numerous findings that proved that the subcontractor company Starting carried out work on the canopy, the competent institutions maintained that the canopy was not the subject of structural interventions, but only rehabilitation according to the conditions of the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments in Novi Sad.

Another important provision of this contract, contained in Article 2.1.29, foresees that traffic on the Novi Sad-Subotica subdivision will be completely closed during construction works, but this does not apply to the Novi Sad and Subotica railway stations. The contract stipulates that the railway stations in Novi Sad and Subotica will be open for passengers during their reconstruction, as well as that they will be used by passengers in stages, which refutes the claims of the Prosecutor's Office that the opening of the station led to the tragedy.

The ""secret"" contract with the Chinese was not secret

Only a few days ago, it turned out that the commercial contract with the Chinese was never protected by the secrecy label, which was invoked by President Aleksandar Vučić immediately after the tragedy in Novi Sad, who even accused the former government of being responsible for the secrecy of contracts with Chinese companies. On November 4, Vučić told Happy television that the Agreement on economic and technical cooperation in the field of infrastructure with China was signed in 2009 by the then Deputy Prime Minister Mlađan Dinkić.

If this contract was never secret, the question arises why the government hid it from the public for almost three months. Was it an attempt by this regime to protect Chinese contractors and domestic subcontractors, and thus money flows that would indicate corruption?

The Prosecutor's Office was instructed

That the contract was magically avoided in the investigation is confirmed by ""Vremena"" information from sources close to the prosecu"

With Pink, he said that he defeated the ""colored revolution"" and when the new government will be formed in the Parliament

The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, said on Sunday evening in the show ""His Tweet"" on Pink TV that the new government of Serbia will be elected ""within one month, one month and five days"", if the resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević is confirmed in the Parliament of Serbia on Friday or Monday, which entails the fall of the entire government.

""Every day I think about who should be the new president."" Those who know me well know that those whose names appear in the newspapers have very little chance,"" answered Vučić when asked if Ana Brnabić could be prime minister again.

And so once again, as he does every day as a guest on all possible televisions, he proved that he violates the powers of the President of the Republic defined by the Constitution and, if anyone listened to him, gave the students and citizens who are protesting demanding the rule of law another argument to not give up in their rebellion.

And as far as Brnabić is concerned, Ana is someone in whom he has absolute confidence.

Vučić repeated that ""the colored revolution is over"", ""one of the dirtiest ever"" (which, admittedly, does not exist in Serbia) and that the opposition, regarding the interim government and possible elections, behaves according to the system ""how little Đokica imagines it"".

He told the students that ""there is nothing wrong with the march to Belgrade on 9,12. or March 15"" nor from the ""occupation of the Assembly and RTS"".

""We will defeat you for a long time because you don't have a plan and programs,"" Vučić said to the opposition.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said tonight that a new government should be formed by March 19th or 20th or early parliamentary elections will be held.

He said that by February 17th or 18th, the Parliament should acknowledge the resignations of the government and Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, which, he said, means that from then on, a 30-day period will begin to run for the formation of a new government or the calling of elections.

Vučić told Radio Television of Serbia that this means that the new government should be formed by March 19 or 20, and if it is not formed, ""it means that the elections would be held in early May.""

""Those are the only two possible options... that is stipulated by the Constitution,"" he said.

He added that he thinks it is good to try to form ""one good government"" because, as he said, it is ""terribly important"" also because of the Specialized World Exhibition EXPO 2027 in Belgrade.

Regarding the student protests and the rejection of his calls for talks, Vučić said that he would continue to insist on dialogue, and assessed that students have more courage than some professors.

""The students have a body called the 'grand meeting of delegates' - if I'm not mistaken... and I expect them to take a serious look at it,"" he said.

He rejected the idea of ​​forming citizens' commissions on various aspects of the collapse of the Novi Sad Railway Station canopy on November 1st last year, when 15 people died.

""If you ask me if I believe in some kind of citizens' commission like those who talk about institutions, which are supposed to replace prosecutors' offices and courts... that's terrifying, ... not that I don't understand it, there is no justification for it,"" Vučić said.

He added that he believes that ""these students"" who will not talk to him, the prosecutors, or anyone else, as he put it, will ""consider their position.""

""That they understand well that this (protests and blockades) must stop and that at some point they must return as winners, but also that they have some kind of control over the processes that will occur in the future from their perspective,"" Vučić said.

Vučić also stated that ""as a political veteran, I wondered how the professors would explain their rejection of his call for dialogue"" and assessed that ""the explanation was not just non-existent, but meaningless.""

He also said that he had nothing against it, and stated that he was ""neither hurt nor vain.""

""I will continue to insist on dialogue and I am not at all interested in who will participate in that dialogue,"" Vučić said.

He called on all those who support ""him and the majority in Serbia"" to be ""absolutely disciplined.""

""It is our job to try to stand still, not to allow impatience and nervousness to force us to take any wrong step,"" he said.

Vučić said that ""these young people (students) are our future"" and ""we must protect them"", and pointed out that ""if an incident occurs, that incident only corresponds to someone else"".

Serbian hydrocarbon company Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS, a subsidiary of Russia’s Gazprom) has submitted a request to the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to postpone financial sanctions for at least 90 days.

Serbia's Energy Minister Dubravka Đedović-Handanović made the corresponding announcement on Feb. 4. She further suggested that the new U.S. administration might lift the restrictions entirely.

“Given that NIS plays a significant role in both the Serbian and regional economy, we have approached OFAC to request a postponement of sanctions by at least 90 days while a decision is under consideration that could lead to their cancellation,” Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted the minister.

According to the official, this request is also supported by the Hungarian government.

The minister added that neither NIS employees nor Serbian citizens should worry about the future, as the country's leadership is committed to protecting their interests.

On Jan. 10, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as their subsidiaries, including NIS. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić claimed that Washington is demanding Belgrade divest all Russian capital from NIS within 45 days.

Currently, Gazprom Neft owns 50% of NIS, Gazprom holds 6.15%. Another 29.87% is owned by Serbia, while the remainder is held by minority shareholders. The Serbian government sold its controlling share of NIS to Gazprom Neft in 2008.

"Secret services in Serbia, the strongest bastion of the government: ""Are you ready to preserve order at all costs?"" - Vijesti.me",https://en.vijesti.me/world-a/balkan/745362/The-secret-services-in-Serbia-are-the-strongest-bastion-of-power.-Are-you-ready-to-maintain-order-at-all-costs%3F,Vijesti.me,2025-02-13,"A few days after the large rally at Slavija, on December 28th to be exact, the then Prime Minister of Serbia Miloš Vučević spoke individually with all the heads of military and civilian security services, asking them whether they were ready to preserve the constitutional order by all means.

Disclaimer: The translations are mostly done through AI translator and might not be 100% accurate.

The great nervousness and fear of the regime's top brass in the face of current events and a rebellious society are expressed in the purges in the security sector, which, after a series of retirements of high-ranking police officers, has spread to the Serbian Army. As Radar has learned from reliable sources, at the end of December, the heads of all security services in the country had separate meetings with the outgoing Prime Minister of Serbia, Miloš Vučević, at which they were supposed to confirm their readiness to defend the current order by all means, if necessary.

Although the managers surveyed in this unusual way answered all questions positively, it is obvious that some felt the need to further demonstrate their loyalty in the following days, while the government thanked others for their work so far, retiring them in almost absolute silence.

Quiet turmoil

Thus, if it were not for the scant news on the website of the Military Intelligence Agency (VOA), the retirement of its director, Brigadier General Zoran Stojković (January 24), would have gone almost unnoticed. His place was taken by the previous deputy director, Colonel Vladimir Planić, a cadre from the Military Security Agency (VBA). The haste in question is also evidenced by the fact that General Stojković retired only a few days after reaching the legal age of 56, although the General Staff itself has a large number of senior officers who are still in active service and have exceeded the retirement age by one or more years.

The above information takes on special significance when placed in the context of related events that took place completely out of the public eye. Namely, according to reliable information obtained by Radar, a little over a month ago and just a few days after the large rally at Slavija, on December 28th to be exact, the current Prime Minister in office, Miloš Vučević, had a very busy working day, and with only one topic. That Tuesday, the SNS president spoke individually with all the heads of the military and civilian security services, surveying them on one single question: whether they were ready to use all means to preserve the constitutional order of the country.

As we learn, the responses he received from the BIA, VBA and VOA collegiums, the Ministry of Interior and the General Staff were positive and temporarily calmed the nervousness of the top government, but also somewhat worrying when it comes to the same readiness of the officer cadre in depth.

Thus, after a decade of dismantling the security services (with an emphasis on the Security Information Agency) by bringing in incompetent people loyal to the ruling party, many of whom were later arrested for classic crimes, the government found itself in a situation where it did not know whom to trust. Radar's interlocutors point out that in a crisis situation like this, the top government increasingly relies on its hard core of followers in the Military Security Agency and special units, which, let us recall, it had previously allowed the recruitment of civilians.

Incidentally, the new VOA Director Colonel Planić, as well as the VBA Director General Đuro Jovanić, were a decade ago members of the same VBA department that deals with counterintelligence and physical and technical security of the Minister of Defense at the time when that function was held by Aleksandar Vučić (2012-2014). The career of Đuro Jovanić, then an adjutant to the current President of the Republic and a captain first class, progressed meteorically in the following years to the rank of major general, at a speed unprecedented in the Serbian Army.

Strange expansion of jurisdiction

This appointment, Radar's interlocutors say, actually completes the informal takeover of the VOA by the VBA, which has already proven its loyalty to the regime of Aleksandar Vučić by closing the army to the public and by waging an open war against the military union and its former leader Novica Antic.

""This is about the undisguised intention of the Military Security Agency to impose its supremacy and literally swallow up military intelligence, which is a very dangerous precedent,"" Aleksandar Radić, a military commentator, tells Radar.

Radar's interlocutor points out that all the VBA's activities in recent years indicate that it has been transformed into a daily political service of the government, even though it is supposed to suppress counterintelligence activities and crime directed against the Serbian Army:

""Now, on the wave of the need for political support for the regime, the VBA is in a position to trade, now they are neede"
New appeal by experts: Aggressive actions to destroy cultural heritage - vreme.com,https://vreme.com/en/kultura/nov-apel-strucnjaka-agresivne-akcije-urusavanja-kulturnog-nasledja/,vreme.com,2025-02-17,"Seven professional organizations and associations sent an appeal to the Government of Serbia to protect cultural heritage and historical assets and to withdraw its harmful decisions. Previous appeals and requests remained unanswered

The Government of Serbia has received another appeal from experts to protect our cultural heritage, which, judging by past experience, will most likely remain unanswered.

As far as is known, the Government of Serbia has not responded to previous appeals/requests to preserve the General Staff and other cultural assets, or even to those sent by international organizations.

Also, despite the reaction of the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments to the Government's decision to revoke the status of a cultural property of the General Staff, that decision is still in force.

Government to cancel the decision on the General Staff

This latest appeal for the protection of cultural heritage and the preservation of historical cultural objects was sent by the International Association of Art Critics AICA - Section Serbia, the Association of Fine Artists of Serbia (ULUS), the Association of Fine Artists of Applied Arts and Designers of Serbia (ULUPUDS), the Association of the Independent Cultural Scene of Serbia (NKSS), the National Committee of ICOM of Serbia, Fakirs from the South and the Museum Society of Serbia (MDS).

The reason for the appeal is primarily ""the decision of the Government of Serbia to delete the General Staff complex (1965), an important piece of architectural and cultural heritage designed by Nikola Dobrović, from the register of cultural assets"".

The fact that the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments ""assessed this Government decision as a gross violation of the Law on Cultural Heritage, indicates a worrying trend of disrespect and neglect of our cultural heritage."" ""Such actions not only violate the integrity of cultural heritage, but also undermine the legal framework established for their protection,"" the appeal says.

Kalemegdan, Fair, Sava Bridge...

Apart from being another protest against neglect of heritage, this appeal is also a story about the buildings that have been destroyed so far, which, presented in one place, is very disturbing.

Apart from the General Staff, the Belgrade Fortress - Kalemegdan was mentioned as an example, given that the renewed initiative to build a cable car to the Ušće Shopping Center threatens the integrity and safety of one of the most important historical locations in the country and at the same time represents a danger to the protected flora and fauna.

Also, the announced demolition and radical changes in the purpose of the Belgrade Fair complex, where only one hall received the status of a cultural asset, although it should have become the entire complex, then the old Sava bridge in Belgrade - despite its historical and architectural value and despite the protests of the citizens of Belgrade, the demolition is scheduled due to potential infrastructural changes that do not guarantee a solution to the traffic collapse in the city, and the ""Cvijeta Zuzorić"" Art Pavilion, whose survival and function have been called into question by carelessness and neglect.

List of destroyed

The signatories of the appeal also pointed to the urban planning solutions of New Belgrade, i.e. the threatening changes that can permanently damage the modernist heritage of that part of the city, then the expansion of Belgrade on the water on the left bank of the Sava, which endangers part of the Memorial Center ""Staro sajmište"" as an important historical location, as well as the further destruction of Vračar and Neimar by unlawfully demolishing villas and cutting trees that destroy the authentic character of those parts of the city.

Then: in the past few years, Belgrade has lost several valuable cultural objects. Among them are the Old Post Office from 1929, the work of Momir Korunović, and Hotel ""Yugoslavija"" from 1969, designed by Lavoslav Horvat. Important buildings were also destroyed, such as the Građanska štedionica from 1929, the work of Stevan Tobolar, the residential house at Topolska 15 from 1927, an early example of modernity in Belgrade architecture, designed by Milan Šlang.

According to the data of the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, 2.657 immovable cultural assets are registered in the central register, of which 2.277 are cultural monuments, 97 spatial cultural-historical entities, 203 archaeological sites and 80 famous places. Each of these monuments has a unique value and importance, and their protection is of vital interest to our community.

Finally, they appeal for ""additional initiative, because the Government ignored the declaration of the Academy of Engineering Sciences of Serbia, the Academy of Architecture of Serbia, the Association of Architects of Serbia and the associations of architects of Belgrade, Novi Sad, Niš, Zrenjanin, Valjevo and Vranje on th"

Voters began casting ballots in Kosovo elections Sunday in a contest that pits combative incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti's quest to stamp out Serbian influence against a fractured opposition's vow to boost the economy.

Kurti and his Vetevendosje (""Self-Determination"") party (VV) have campaigned on their efforts to dismantle the remaining Serbian institutions in Kosovo while expanding the government's reach to Serb-majority areas.

Those pledges have been well received by large swathes of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, with one of the few available polls projecting that VV was on course to capture roughly half of the vote.

Kurti's campaign has sought to drive home the message, insisting the government is in greater control of Kosovo's territory than at any other time since independence.

""It will be a historic referendum on Sunday,"" Kurti said at a campaign rally in Pristina Friday night, emphasising the need to secure 500,000 votes to form a majority government.

Animosity between Kosovo and Serbia has persisted since the war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents in the late 1990s.

Serbia has steadfastly refused to acknowledge Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008.

Since the war's end, remnants of Serbian government institutions continued to provide services -- ranging from health care to education -- to Serbs inside Kosovo.

But in the past year, Kurti has sought to end that status quo.

Voting began at 07:00 am (0600 GMT) and will end 12 hours later, when exit polls are expected.

Kosovo's authorities have effectively outlawed the use of the Serbian dinar, closed banks and shuttered the post offices where Serbian pension payments were cashed.

Belgrade-backed government and tax offices have also been closed and Serbian car plates banned.

The moves have heightened the uneasy relations between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority and its Serb minority in the run-up to the polls.

Once known for antagonistic stunts such as letting off tear gas in parliament, the VV has grown from a street movement led by Kurti in the 2000s to Kosovo's dominant political party.

Kurti's government is the first to finish its full term in office since the breakaway Serbian province declared independence.

But Kurti's rule has been turbulent, marked by regular unrest between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.

Tensions spiked after EU- and US-backed negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia all but collapsed in March 2023.\

In the aftermath, NATO peacekeepers were assaulted by rioting Serbs, a deadly armed standoff in the north sent regional tensions soaring and an explosion targeting a canal vital to

Kosovo's power plants late last year saw Kurti blaming Belgrade.

Throughout the unrest, Kurti has remained unwavering, even if it meant running afoul of Kosovo's vital allies in the United States and Europe.

But his supporters have praised his vision.

""You can see the things (Kurti) has done. He is irreplaceable,"" Zek Kurtaj, 40, told AFP after landing at the Pristina airport on Saturday ahead of the vote.

Others suggest Kurti's actions may have been overly disruptive.

Kurti ""has been repeatedly accused by opposition parties of delivering little, defying the international community, and complaining about Serbia while missing out on opportunities to build infrastructure and develop Kosovo economically,"" wrote Jonathan Moore, an analyst from the Atlantic Council's Europe Center.

""The results of this election will be a critical indicator of Kosovo's future.""

Many of Kurti's rivals -- which include more than two dozen opposition parties in the contest -- have sought to focus on Kosovo's economic uncertainty.

Kosovo remains one of the poorest economies in Europe, with roughly 12 percent of its population emigrating since 2011.

Xhavit Haliti of the right-wing Democratic Party of Kosovo -- considered one of the VV's strongest opponents -- has slammed Kurti for fraying ties with Washington and Brussels.

Meanwhile, the Democratic League of Kosovo led by economist Lumir Abdixhiku has vowed to increase salaries and boost pensions.

In ethnic Serb areas, the Belgrade-backed Serb List party has campaigned on familiar vows to protect the rights of Kosovo's dwindling Serb minority.

""Any Serb who does not vote tomorrow or who votes against the Serb List de facto gives their vote to Kurti and to those who obey him,"" party leader Zlatan Elek told local media.

The resignation of Miloš Vučević has reached the Serbian Parliament - vreme.com,https://vreme.com/en/vesti/ostavka-milosa-vucevica-stigla-u-skupstinu-srbije/,vreme.com,2025-02-05,"""A resignation has arrived in the Assembly.""

I guess they didn't want to waste paper on it until they received the notification of withdrawal from the proposal procedure for the Ministers of Construction and Trade,"" the document published by Đorđević states.

On January 28, Miloš Vučević resigned from the post of Prime Minister of Serbia. As he explained, he resigned because he believes that he is objectively responsible for the attack on students that happened in Novi Sad.

The news that the document with the resignation of Miloš Vučević has reached the Assembly comes after Transparency sent official request To the Government and the Assembly to submit the text of the resignation. The day before, ""Vreme"" wrote about the fact that it seems to be Vucevic submitted his resignation only on television.

Namely, Vucevic said at the press conference last week that he was resigning, which would also mean the fall of the Government.

However, the law says that the Prime Minister must officially inform the President of the Assembly about it, and then the Parliament, at the first next session, only notes the resignation.

Serbia is in an undeclared state of emergency - vreme.com,https://www.vreme.com/en/vesti/srbija-je-u-neproglasenom-vanrednom-stanju/,vreme.com,2025-02-07,"""We are practically living in a state of emergency, only no one has publicly acknowledged it,"" Dragan Popović from the Center for Practical Politics told Vreme. Daily protests and road blockades throughout Serbia, the blockade of universities and the judiciary due to a strike by lawyers, a part of secondary schools, a reflection of civil disobedience, announcements of new strikes speak of a deep social and political crisis.

Serbia is in a state of emergency. It is enough just to go out on the street and see how obvious it is. Not only that half of the country is blocked, that schools are not working regularly, that many professions are in a kind of suspension of work and civil disobedience, but also the work of the judiciary is blocked due to the lawyers' strike, and on top of all that Vlada in his resignation, Dragan Popović from the Center for Practical Politics told ""Vreme"".

""We are practically living in a state of emergency, only no one has publicly acknowledged it,"" says Popović.

He points out that it is very difficult to predict how long such a situation can last, especially when it comes to the problem with the Government of Serbia.

""Energy on the street still exists, primarily among students, but also in other parts of society, and that cannot be resolved through elections, nor can anyone from the opposition agree to the elections,"" says Popović.

A kind of mat

He adds that people on the streets will demand the fulfillment of student demands, first of all, that the institutions start doing their work.

However, Popović emphasizes that it is a kind of stalemate, to put it in chess terms - because the institutions cannot fulfill the students' demands.

""That's why this situation cannot be solved by classic ways to get out of the crisis, nor are we in a classic position, because we are in a state of emergency."" First, we have to admit that everything is extraordinary in this country, and then look for some extraordinary solutions, such as a transitional or expert government. In short, we need a government that can fulfill the students' demands in order to get out of the chaos,"" says Popović.

Speaking about Vučić's unsuccessful attempt to create discord among students and professors, but also among universities by inviting the Rector's College from the University of Belgrade to a dialogue, Popović assessed that Vučić did not learn anything from that failure.

""He certainly didn't learn anything from that, and I'm surprised that in the past three months he's managed so poorly to create more discord."" I'm not surprised by the coaster attempts. Everything you can think of that an authoritarian government could implement - they implement it,"" says Popović.

He warns that the regime will try to use everything it can, including the ""political police under its control"", the security services and the tabloids.

""They will do everything to break up the protests and I am sure that we are not at the end of that process, they will continue to do that, and on the other side it is to show how strong it is and to resist such attempts,"" concludes Popović.

Vučić is not ready to hand over power

The rapporteur of the European Parliament for Serbia, Tonino Picula, believes that Serbia is in an ""undeclared state of emergency"".

He told Radio Free Europe that Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić did not find a way to compensate for the dissatisfaction of those protesting.

He added that it is up to the students and citizens who are protesting to decide how to continue the protests, but that they must articulate them politically.

He reminded that Vučić had hinted that he was not ready to hand over power to an expert group, that is, to an interim transitional government.

Picula assessed that elections are not a solution if some kind of social consensus is not found during them and indicated that there are no indications that this time would be any different.

Who is all blocked or suspended

The blockades of the faculties started with the blockade of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts, which was a response to the attack on the students of that faculty. In the meantime, all universities in Serbia are under blockade.

Their example was followed by a large number of high schools, as well as some elementary schools, so high school students and their teachers can be seen daily at roadblocks. Teachers at the ""Ivo Andrić"" Elementary School in Belgrade even signed blank resignations and completely suspended the start of the second semester.

Special attention of the public was caused by the suspension of the work of lawyers, which should last for a whole month. In the explanation for the suspension of work, the lawyers stated that ""none of the demands of the student protests have been met"" and added that this is not the only reason, but that the reasons are also dissatisfaction with the work of the courts and prosecutor's offices that ignore ""gross violations of the rights of citizens"" and ""tolerate illegalities in the work of judic"

BELGRADE - Anger drove Marija Petrovic to join student protests in Belgrade in November. A railway station roof had collapsed days earlier in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people. Thugs then set upon demonstrators who were calling for justice for the dead.

Initially there was little sign of wider support for the protesters, who blamed government corruption and nepotism for what they say was shoddy construction work on a recently-renovated roof. The government denies the allegations.

Three months on, however, the demonstrations have ballooned into the biggest protest movement in Serbia in years. Joined by tens of thousands of teachers, lawyers and other workers, the highly organised students have taken over faculty buildings, blocked highways and squares and triggered a political crisis.

""Any of us could have been under that roof,"" said Petrovic, a student of molecular biology at the University of Belgrade, a focal point of the protests, as she prepared to head to a rally on Thursday.

Serbia's Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and the ministers for construction and trade have all stepped down because of the disaster, but that has failed to quell people protesting what they say is an autocratic regime.

Students protest daily, and paint their hands red to represent the blood that they say is on the government's hands. Demonstrators are expected to rally in the city of Kragujevac on Saturday in what may be the largest gathering yet.

Five students who spoke to Reuters say the protest's success so far is down to their strict organisation, clear demands, daily coordination, and a lack of hierarchy that has made it hard for the government to target leaders. Even the spokesperson changes daily.

Students sleep in university buildings, living on food and drink donations. Lectures have stopped. The protest message is tightly controlled: that the government must do its job properly and honestly, and that the demonstrations will not end until it does.

The students have not called for the overthrow of President Aleksandar Vucic. But their persistence has created one of the biggest threats to the president's long grip on power, political analysts said.

""Vucic finds himself in what is probably the most vulnerable position since his party first formed the government in 2012,"" said Mario Bikarski, senior Europe analyst, at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.

""The perception of corruption remains the key issue for protesters, who are likely to remain active until they receive meaningful guarantees on the issue.""

UNDER PRESSURE

Vucic became prime minister in 2014. In 2017, he was elected president, a traditionally ceremonial role which he has bolstered by maintaining influence over his SNS party.

He is seen as a strategic player internationally, given Serbia's historic ties with Russia and the West. But opposition parties and rights watchdogs accuse him and his SNS party of bribing voters, stifling media freedom, violence against opponents and ties with organised crime.

Vucic and his allies deny these allegations. But Serbia's rating on Transparency International's global corruption index has worsened gradually in recent years. It now sits 105th out of 180 countries.

The students' demands include the publication of documents related to the station roof collapse; justice for those responsible; the dismissal of charges against protesting students; and a greater budget for higher education.

Vucic says he has met those demands.

Prosecutors in December indicted 13 people over the awning collapse, including the former minister of infrastructure, who denied responsibility.

""I hope that the blockades will stop, they are destroying our economy,"" he said in an address this week.

Students are unmoved.

Large-scale protests continue in Serbia

In the three months since 15 people died when a roof collapsed at a newly renovated train station in the city of Novi Sad, mass demonstrations have grown into the largest protest movement in Serbia in years and pose the most serious threat to populist President Aleksandar Vucic's decade-long hold on power.

On Saturday morning, despite the low temperatures, students arrived in Kragujevac from all over the country, including on foot from Belgrade, 140 km away. They carried national flags, beat drums and blew whistles. The locals welcomed them with joy and support.

The protesters planned to block one of the city's main boulevards for 3:15 p.m. as a symbolic tribute to the victims. They observed 15 minutes of silence in memory of the dead.

Protests have continued daily since the tragedy, with participants blocking roads and seizing university buildings. Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević and two other ministers resigned over the protests, and prosecutors have indicted 13 people, but that has not stopped the demonstrations. Share

Students are demanding that the authorities release documents regarding the station roof collapse, justice for those responsible, the dropping of charges against the demonstrators, and an increase in the budget for higher education.

Recall that on November 1, 2024, part of the outer roof of the railway station in the Serbian city of Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people."

PRISTINA: Voters began casting ballots in Kosovo elections on Sunday in a contest that pits combative incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti´s quest to stamp out Serbian influence against a fractured opposition´s vow to boost the economy.

Kurti and his Vetevendosje (“Self-Determination”) party (VV) have campaigned on their efforts to dismantle the remaining Serbian institutions in Kosovo while expanding the government´s reach to Serb-majority areas.

Those pledges appear to have been well received by large swaths of Kosovo´s ethnic Albanian majority, with one of the few available polls projecting that VV was on course to capture roughly half of the vote.

Kurti´s campaign has sought to drive home the message, insisting the government is in greater control of Kosovo´s territory than at any other time since independence. “I thank all the citizens of Kosovo who voted so far and encourage everybody to vote. Exercise your democratic right to make your voice heard,” said Kurti as voting got under way across Kosovo.

Animosity between Kosovo and Serbia has persisted since the war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian insurgents in the late 1990s. Serbia has steadfastly refused to acknowledge Kosovo´s declaration of independence in 2008. Since the war´s end, remnants of Serbian government institutions continued to provide services -- ranging from health care to education -- to Serbs inside Kosovo."

On the orders of the Special Department for High-Tech Crime of the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade, the police arrested MT for the criminal offense of endangering security, pro-government tabloids in Serbia announced this morning.

MT, who is said to be posing as Mladen Tanjga on social media, allegedly posted verses on Twitter (X) ""in which he directly threatens the family of President Aleksandar Vučić.""

Večernje Novosti writes that, in the published poem, MT ""made chilling threats to Vučić's family"", specifically to his daughter, wife, mother and father.

Serbian Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabić stated that MT, who made ""disgusting threats to President Aleksandar Vučić and his family"" on social media, had been arrested, but she asked the public to carefully monitor what happens next in this case.

""It often happens that those (who make threats) receive the mildest possible sentences. I don't know whether the person who made the threats deserved only prison or some serious psychiatric treatment,"" Brnabić told TV Pink.

Uncertainty looms in Kosovo parliamentary polls - eNCA,https://www.enca.com/opinion/uncertainty-looms-kosovo-parliamentary-polls,eNCA,2025-02-10,"PRISTINA - Prime Minister Albin Kurti's ruling party appeared set to secure the most seats in Kosovo's parliamentary elections on Sunday but it remained uncertain whether he stood a chance of forming a majority government.

Sunday's contest largely pitted Kurti's quest to stamp out Serbian influence on Kosovo's soil during his time as premier against the opposition's vow to boost the economy in one of the poorest pockets of Europe.

Without a single party winning a clear majority in the 120-seat parliament, Kosovo would likely be headed for days, if not weeks, of coalition talks and political horse-trading.

Twenty seats are reserved for minority parties, including 10 for Kosovo's ethnic Serbs.

A projection published by leading Kosovo news outlet KOHA said Kurti's Vetevendosje (""Self-Determination"") party (VV) was leading the race with an estimated 42 percent of votes.

The right-wing Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) trailed in second with 21 percent followed by the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) with 20 percent."

The resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević has reached the National Assembly, Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) has learned.

The media outlet states that some opposition MPs posted a photo of a document on social media showing that the date of receipt was January 28th, when Vučević resigned.

The outgoing Prime Minister stated earlier today that a decision will be made in the next ten days to two weeks on whether a new government will be formed or new elections will be held.

Vučević also said that the issue of holding a session of the Serbian Parliament, at which his resignation will be confirmed, is also related to the decision on the Government or elections in terms of the upcoming deadlines.

What does the Constitution say?

According to Article 132 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister submits his resignation to the President of the National Assembly and simultaneously informs the President of the Republic and the public thereof.

In accordance with the same article, the National Assembly, at its first subsequent session, shall note the resignation of the Prime Minister, thereby terminating the Government's mandate.

After that, the President of the Republic is obliged to initiate the procedure for the election of a new Government.

If the National Assembly fails to elect a new Government within 30 days of the date of the resignation of the Prime Minister, the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve the Assembly and call elections.

She stated to RTV Dukagjini that NATO does not interfere in domestic politics, but expects a functional government and progress in the dialogue with Serbia, which she sees as essential for regional stability.

""In general, we have passed into an unstable situation and when there are elections in the region, like these, a special agenda should be devoted to it. But, fortunately, the elections passed and did not have a direct impact on stability. It is clear that citizens exercised their right to vote and now it is definitely the post-election process that matters the most. But this is not something that NATO neither interferes nor influences. We expect that a government that represents the institutions of Kosovo will be elected.





""And in fact we want movement on the issue of dialogue, progress in the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. We believe that this is a proper investment in the further stability of the region,"" said Shekerinska.

Regarding security, Shekerinska recalled that NATO has increased the number of KFOR troops in response to several events – such as the terrorist attack in Basnjska, Zvecan.

""What we have done since some of the incidents that happened in Kosovo is of course to increase our KFOR troops. And I think that speaks volumes about NATO's commitment, the investments that we are making there and supporting political dialogue,"" added the NATO Deputy Secretary General.

Regarding Kosovo's membership in NATO, Shekerinska emphasized that this is an issue that requires further progress in the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue.

""When it comes to NATO membership, this is actually another phase and for this we really need to see progress in the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. That is why we support the EU-led dialogue. We want to move forward and discuss issues that are in the interest of everyone in the region,"" the NATO Deputy Secretary General emphasized."

""Fighting corruption, maintaining the rule of law, and strengthening institutions are key principles to which we remain fully committed - and that is why we have prioritized addressing them and appreciate that the students have brought these topics to the forefront,"" the text, which was broadcast by TV N1, states.

The text also states that ""that is why the Serbian Government fulfilled all their (student) demands.""

It is added that in the last three months, student and citizen gatherings have taken place peacefully, without the use of state force, even though they were not officially registered, as required by law.

According to the text, the government has made every effort to ensure that, despite the fact that they were not announced, these gatherings are properly secured, and the safety of all participants is guaranteed.

The government has also reportedly issued instructions for the police to provide security at every gathering.

""The government and state services have condemned every incident that threatened the safety of students and citizens during the gathering. Additionally, those responsible have been detained, and legal proceedings are underway for the most serious violations,"" it is emphasized.

The text states that, despite bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice, political responsibility has also been demonstrated.

""The Prime Minister took personal political responsibility and resigned following the incident involving members of his party. As a result, not only were the perpetrators quickly identified and brought to justice, but as a result of the shameful act of violence against students, both the Prime Minister and the Mayor of Novi Sad resigned,"" it writes.

It appears that the government has acknowledged the challenges and is fully committed to addressing them, especially in the context of accelerating and strengthening Serbia's European integration process.

""Therefore, Serbia's goal is to accelerate its path towards the EU, proposing to fulfill all obligations by the end of 2026. These are precisely the values ​​that Europe supports - the rule of law, the fight against corruption and freedom of the media,"" it states.

It is also stated that ""an accelerated European path is crucial for Serbia to effectively address these issues and implement meaningful reforms.""

""While we are faced with the politicization of certain NGO (non-governmental organization) representatives and their involvement in the country's internal political affairs, Serbia has no intention of expelling or banning any NGO,"" it states.

It was also pointed out that ""on the contrary, Serbia welcomes and expects their active participation in the reforms that the country is committed to implementing.""

""A strong and engaged civil society is essential for a clear, unambiguous European path and the successful implementation of reforms,"" ​​it emphasizes.

According to the text, the four key principles, as stated, ""that the president, the government and all state institutions adhere to are dialogue, peaceful resolution of problems, accelerated European integration and condemnation of all types of violence.""

It is emphasized that the demands of students and citizens have been recognized and responded to, and the text continues with a list of student demands, explaining that they have all been met.

It is stated that the criminal investigation was launched the day after the collapse of the Novi Sad Railway Station canopy – November 2, 2024, and it is mentioned that dozens of people were questioned, including 20 individuals within 24 hours of the tragedy.

An investigation into corruption was launched on February 2, 2025, in response to criticism that the initial investigation was insufficient, and geological engineer Zoran Đajić also testified, the text says.

PRISTINA - Kosovo's ruling Vetevendosje party came first in Sunday's parliamentary election, but fell short of an outright majority needed to rule without coalition partners, preliminary results showed on Monday.

Despite a drop in support from a 2021 vote, the result sets up Prime Minister Albin Kurti to lead the next government in the small Balkan country where politics are dominated by the relationship with neighbouring Serbia and Serbs within its borders.

A government led by Kurti, a leftist and Albanian nationalist, is likely to continue policies to extend government control over the north, where about 50,000 ethnic Serbs live, many of whom refuse to recognise Kosovo's independence from Serbia in 2008.

That worries moderates who fear a return to the ethnic violence that has blighted the region in recent years.

Vetevendosje won 41.3% of votes with 88% of ballots counted, down from more than 50% in the 2021 poll that brought a Vetevendosje-led coalition to power, results from the election commission showed. The opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo was second with 21.8% and the Democratic League of Kosovo party had 17.8%.

""Preliminary results show one true, exact and clear thing, and this is that the Vetevendosje movement has won the elections of February 9, 2025,"" Kurti told supporters in the capital Pristina as crowds let off fireworks, banged drums and waved Albanian flags.

But in the same speech Kurti insulted potential coalition partners by saying the opposition were ""animals"" and ""thieves"" ready to make a deal ""with the devil"" against his government.

During an acrimonious election campaign, in which fines for misconduct trebled over the 2021 poll, Kurti said he would refuse to rule with a coalition.

Pristina-based political analyst Belgzim Kamberi told Reuters that Kurti would have to make a deal with second or third party or allow the opposition to form the new government.

""Kosovo has entered into an institutional instability,"" he said.

Kosovo, which is majority ethnic Albanian, is Europe's newest country, and one of its poorest. It gained independence from Serbia in 2008 with backing from the United States after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces in 1999.

The election campaign saw debates over corruption, crime, health and education, but looming in the background is the situation in the north, where Kurti's moves to reduce ethnic Serbs' autonomy has stoked tensions and isolated it from the European Union and the United States.

The EU placed economic curbs on the country in 2023 for its role in the tensions, cutting at least 150 million euros ($155 million) in funding, Reuters found. REUTERS

""What is important is that discussions with professors and university representatives begin as soon as possible, that no one avoids their responsibility, that they understand well that conversation is healing and that solutions can only be reached through conversation,"" Vučić said in a video on Instagram.

Speaking about the election of a new Serbian government after the resignation of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, he assessed that it must be a ""Serbian government"", or new elections should be held.

""At the same time, I am absolutely unwavering in my judgment that Serbia can and must only have a Serbian government, if that is possible at all; if not, then we must hold new elections. We do not need governments imposed from outside and governments imposed without elections and without the will of the people.""

He thanked all citizens who participated in the protests yesterday and today, as well as the ""huge number of citizens"" who disagreed with the content of those protests and who calmly waited for the demonstrations to end.

""That is a very important lesson for all of us. Important because we have preserved peace, stability and hope for the future.""

Vučić also thanked all citizens who, as he said, are sending words of support to the state of Serbia, ""concerned about the situation in the country with the desire for many things to change for the better in the future.""

""I said this because I will be an unwavering critic of all those who think that the fair atmosphere and the Exit atmosphere are the right way to honor those who died in the Novi Sad tragedy.""

Serbian PM resigns over contracting scandal - The Mandarin,https://www.themandarin.com.au/285774-serbian-pm-resigns-over-contracting-scandal/,The Mandarin,2025-02-03,"If you like this article, share it with your friends.

Serbian leaders have been under pressure to resign since the collapse of a train station canopy in Novi Sad last year.

Serbian Prime Minister Miloš Vučević has resigned to “defuse tensions” after almost three months of escalating anti-corruption protests.

Demonstrations erupted following the collapse of a train station canopy in Novi Sad in November. The incident killed 15 and severely wounded two.

A growing number of Serbians blame this on the mismanagement of substantial renovation of the station that ended four months earlier.

At least 13 people have been arrested. These includes former transport minister Goran Vesic, who resigned shortly after the incident.

A spokesperson for the public prosecutor in Novi Sad said there was a “justified suspicion they have committed a serious offence against general safety.”

Vučević said he felt compelled to take responsibility for the protests.

“I opted to step aside today to calm tensions,” he said.

“This shows that we who were elected to assume responsibility are assuming responsibility so that the situation does not spill over onto the streets and lead to disputes between citizens and divisions in society.”

The intricacies of Serbia’s government transparency laws don’t permit a line-by line view of the construction contracts for the renovation. But investigations by a number of local outlets suggest a number of serious issues.

Detailed costings for the project weren’t completed until two years after a price had been agreed, and the contractor hired.

Nova Ekonomija reported the cost of the station’s renovations had topped €16 million; almost five times the original contract value of €3.5 million.

Transparency Serbia director Nemanja Nenadić said this showed the need to reform government procurement.

“This is another proof that Serbia must stop the practice of contracting such works without a tender,” he said.

“If it was already contracted in that way, the representatives of our government would have to present to the deputies and citizens, on the basis of which calculations they concluded the price we will pay for these works is realistic.”"

Disclaimer: The translations are mostly done through AI translator and might not be 100% accurate.

Serbian Minister of Interior and President of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Ivica Dačić, stated today that the party is always against early elections, not because it is afraid of them, but because the state needs regularity in its functioning, and that it is also against the establishment of a transitional government.

""You heard what President Aleksandar Vučić said (about the interim government), I know the man and I am sure that what he said is the absolute truth, and that means that he will never be in favor of it. Since he is proposing a prime minister, it means that he will never go towards that, but rather towards respecting the elections. I am sure that he will not do it if he gives someone a mandate without elections,"" Dačić told TV Pink.

According to him, coming to power without elections is unacceptable for Vučić, as someone who proposes a prime minister, and the SPS would not accept such a thing.

When asked if he would accept to be the prime minister-designate if Vučić offered him the job, he said that he had never heard such nonsense when some journalists asked him if it was true that he had rejected such an offer.

""I certainly do not belong to the category of people who do not want to deal with all these problems. The main question is what is the concept of the new government, we will discuss everything. The most important thing is what the president intends, I do not know what proposals he has in mind,"" Dačić said.

Speaking about the movement whose formation was again announced by Vučić, he stated that the idea would be discussed, but that it certainly does not imply the abolition of the SPS or the Serbian Progressive Party and the formation of another party.

""It is absolutely untrue that there will be any kind of drowning of the SPS. We will maintain our uniqueness, independence. It is not possible for us to abolish our party in order to drown ourselves in something else, that is not the goal. I want to put an end to that, so that there are no rumors,"" Dačić said.

Speaking about the blockade of bridges in Novi Sad, announced for today, Dačić called on everyone to keep it peaceful.

""We didn't even think about using force, or intervening. Unless someone attacks the police or wants to break into state institutions,"" said Dačić, stating that there is communication with the police during blockades.

According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), India and Serbia have close and friendly ties. India gives principled support to territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and has not recognized Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by Kosovo. Serbia has been supportive of election of Indian candidates in international fora. India and Serbia also share common views on many major global issues.

Serbian people have lot of interest in Indian culture and Mission has been taking initiatives to enhance and deepen its activities. There is also a lot of interest in Serbia on Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore visited Serbia in 1926 and gave two lectures in the Belgrade University, MEA added.

Further, the MEA noted that Serbia has two streets named after Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru with the busts of the two leaders. The streets were named in 1970s and the busts of the leaders installed in late 1990s (Nehru) & 2007 (Mahatma Gandhi), on the occasion of declaration of October 2 as the International Day of Non-violence. Serbia co-sponsored India's Resolutions at UN for declaring October 2 as International Day of Non-violence and June 21 as International Day of Yoga.

Resumption of Pristina-Belgrade Dialogue: Analysts Say It Depends on Kosovo’s New Government - euronews.al,https://euronews.al/en/resumption-of-pristina-belgrade-dialogue-analysts-say-it-depends-on-kosovos-new-government/,euronews.al,2025-02-16,"The resumption of dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which was also mentioned by the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, appears to be contingent on the formation of Kosovo’s new government and the ongoing political crisis in Serbia.

According to analysts in Pristina, potential developments in this direction could emerge as early as March.

“There will be some movement in the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, but for a serious step forward, we need to wait for the confirmation of the new coalition. Even if the new government is not voted in immediately, we still need to wait for the coalition to be established for any serious progress. Let’s not forget that there are upcoming elections in Europe, particularly in Germany and France, as well as the ongoing political crisis in Serbia. So, it’s not just elections in Kosovo, but also political developments in other countries that influence this process. However, we can expect some moves from the European Commission soon. Hopefully, they have reflected on the situation and will present a more realistic proposal for implementing the Kosovo-Serbia agreements,” said analyst Seb Bytyqi.

However, not everyone shares this optimism.

*“Neither Kosovo nor Serbia will be able to make major decisions for some time. The EU follows a set trajectory, so no major changes are expected. But one new factor that could bring change is the Trump administration, which has shown interest in the region. Once the issues of Gaza and Ukraine are no longer at the forefront of discussions, I believe the Balkans will receive more attention. At that point, everything will become unpredictable, just like the political approach of the Trump administration.

A great opportunity was lost with the Biden administration, as the issue could have been resolved in a more diplomatic manner. Now, with Trump, everything is uncertain—there could be significant gains but also major losses. For these reasons, I believe the dialogue is facing a period of great uncertainty,”* said political analyst Artan Muhaxhiri.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated this week that, along with the new EU envoy for the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, Peter Sørensen, they will attempt to make the dialogue process functional again.

Meanwhile, state leaders from Kosovo and Serbia held separate meetings with Sørensen during the Munich Security Conference.

In his meeting with Sørensen, Kosovo’s Prime Minister Albin Kurti emphasized that Serbia has violated the Basic Agreement of Brussels and the Ohrid Annex. He further stated that, for the dialogue to move forward, Serbia must sign the agreement, withdraw the letter sent by its former prime minister to the European Union, and hand over Milan Radoičić, the lead terrorist responsible for the Serbian terrorist attack in Banjska in 2023."

No time? blue News summarizes for you Three months after the collapse of a train station canopy that killed 15 people in Novi Sad, tens of thousands of people have once again protested in the Serbian city against the abuses in the country.

The demonstrators blocked three important bridges over the Danube from 3 p.m. and wanted to keep them occupied for at least three hours, one of them even for 24 hours.

The demonstrators waved flags, held up posters and chanted slogans. Show more

Thousands of people have occupied three Danube bridges in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad in protest against the government controlled by President Aleksandar Vucic. The reason for this is the collapse of the station canopy in this city exactly three months ago, which killed 15 people. The protesters blame the government and state apparatus for the accident. In their view, corruption and incompetence were the cause. One of the three bridges was to remain occupied by demonstrators for 24 hours, they said.

The day before, hundreds of young people from Belgrade had already walked the more than 60 kilometers to Novi Sad and were greeted and fed by the population at their stations. It was a new form of the mass protests that have been going on for months as a result of the accident. Even Prime Minister Milos Vucevic's resignation could not calm the anger of the people.

Outgoing prime minister calls on government camp to exercise restraint

Outgoing Prime Minister Vucevic called on supporters of the ruling party and other opponents of the protests not to approach the demonstrators in order to avoid incidents, reported the Belgrade news agency Tanjug. Meanwhile, President Vucic is faced with the decision of appointing a new prime minister or bringing forward new elections.

Since the accident at Novi Sad railroad station, many people in Serbia have been demonstrating almost daily. Their main complaint is that the authorities and the judiciary are not ensuring transparency regarding the causes of this accident."

Kosovo Ministers Assist the Serbian Government in Artana - Telegrafi,https://telegrafi.com/en/Kosovo-ministers-assist-Serbian-government-in-Artane/,Telegrafi,2025-02-08,"LDK candidate for mayor of Artana (Novobërdë), Bajrush Ymeri, says that yesterday and today, the company ""Al Trade"" from Pristina has been distributing construction materials to the Serbs here. This company is contracted by the Ministry for Returns and Communities, led by Dalibor Jevtic.

Ymeri says he is not surprised by the Serbian MUP's interference in the elections in Artana. He would not even be surprised if there were Serbian companies lobbying for their Serbian candidate, reports rajonipress.

However, Ymeri is disappointed when he sees the Albanian company ""Al Trade"" from Pristina, which is contracted by the Ministry for Returns and Communities to Dalibor Jevtic.

This company, according to Ymer, distributed construction material aid all day Saturday and today.





""In addition to Serbia, which wants to beat me to the punch at all costs, unfortunately there are also Serbian ministers in the Kosovo Government through an Albanian company. This is regrettable because the Prime Minister is also aware of it, but with his silence and inaction he has shown that he is also against me. I am left alone in this very difficult process and I cannot resist the blackmail, threats, and pressures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which are being exerted on Serbian citizens despite their desire to vote for me,"" said Ymeri.

Ymeri said that he has notified the police about the company ""Al Trade"" and they are being questioned about the distribution of this aid. /Telegrafi/

Serbia's Youth Rise: Protests Ignite Against Government After Tragedy - Devdiscourse,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/education/3266289-serbias-youth-rise-protests-ignite-against-government-after-tragedy,Devdiscourse,2025-02-15,"Serbia witnessed a monumental outpouring of discontent as tens of thousands of students gathered in Kragujevac, protesting government inaction following a tragic railway incident in Novi Sad. The disaster, attributed to corruption, claimed 15 lives, triggering nationwide demonstrations.

The protestors, consisting of students, teachers, and workers, traveled from Belgrade and beyond, symbolically blocking boulevards and observing moments of silence for the victims. Demonstrations have intensified, calling for systemic reform and increased education funding, despite resignations in the government and ongoing charges against those involved.

Local residents supported the cause, providing sustenance and joining the rally. As the movement gains momentum, President Vucic is expected to address his supporters, while the protesters remain steadfast in their demands for justice and accountability.

Serbia: Anti-government protests refuse to stop - ProtoThema,https://en.protothema.gr/2025/02/06/serbia-anti-government-protests-refuse-to-stop/,ProtoThema,2025-02-06,"Newsroom February 6 04:30

Anti-government protests in Serbia continue to gain momentum, fuelled by public outrage over government corruption and mismanagement. The demonstrations erupted following the collapse of a newly built roof at the Novi Sad railway station on November 1, which killed 15 people.

The resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic nearly ten days ago has failed to appease protesters, who march daily demanding accountability. Their defining symbol: a bloody palm, representing their anger and grief.

Students Lead the Movement, Joined by Teachers and Farmers

The protests are led by students, with teachers and farmers joining them in Tuesday’s mass demonstration in Kragujevac, Serbia’s fourth-largest city. Thousands of protesters waved banners and blew whistles, expressing their frustration with the government.

Among them was Marija Greno, who told Reuters:

“The only way to defuse the situation is for the government to back down step by step. President Vucic is facing an unprecedented crisis—he has the people rising up against him.”

What began as a reaction to the Novi Sad roof collapse has evolved into a nationwide movement. Over the past three months, the protests have spread across the country, gaining momentum with each passing day.

“Laws and Rules Exist Only on Paper”

Protester Branko Jovanovic emphasized that Serbia’s problems go beyond this tragedy:

“For 12 to 13 years, we have seen increasing issues with centralized power. It is naive to expect quick solutions, but we will persist. Corruption and the collapse of institutions won’t disappear overnight, but we are ready for a long fight.”

Serbian prosecutors have indicted 13 people in connection with the Novi Sad disaster, but protesters and opposition leaders blame systemic corruption. They allege that bribery allowed the rushed, substandard construction of the railway station’s shelter, with no proper oversight or adherence to safety regulations.

Pressure Mounts on President Vucic

As protests escalate, pressure on President Aleksandar Vucic grows. On Wednesday, hundreds of pensioners rallied in Belgrade, standing in solidarity with the students. Among them was Dusanka Novakovic, who criticized the government’s failure to uphold the law:

“In Serbia, laws and rules exist only on paper. They are not enforced.”

With no signs of protest fatigue, the Serbian government faces one of its most significant challenges yet."
